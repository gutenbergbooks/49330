<h2>THE STINGY RECEIVER </h2>



<h3>I</h3>

<p>"If I were fifty years old," said the Young Doctor quite
bluntly, "and found myself suddenly stripped of practically
all my motor powers except my pocketbook and my sense of
humor; and was told that I could make one wish&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"But I am fifty years old," admitted the Sick Woman. "And I
do find myself stripped of practically all my motor powers,
except my pocketbook and my sense of humor!" </p>

<p>"Then for Heaven's sake&mdash;wish!" snapped the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness!" mocked the Sick Woman. "You're not by any
chance a&mdash;a fairy god-doctor, are you?" </p>

<p>"Fairy god-doctor?" bristled the young <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>man. "The phrase is an
unfamiliar one to me," he confided with some hauteur. </p>

<p>Quizzically then for a moment among her hotel pillows the
woman lay staring out through the open window into the
indefinite slate-roofed vista of Beyond&mdash;and Beyond&mdash;and
Beyond. Then so furtively that the whites of her eyes showed
suddenly like a snarling dog's she glanced back at the Young
Doctor's grimly inscrutable face. </p>

<p>"You're  quite sure that it isn't a will you want me to make?
Not a wish?" she asked. </p>

<p>"Quite sure," said the Young Doctor, without emotion. </p>

<p>As two antagonists searching desperately for some weak spot
in each other's mental armor, the patient's eyes narrowed to
the doctor's, the doctor's to the patient's. </p>

<p>It was the patient who fled first from the probe. </p>

<p>"How many years can you give me?" she surrendered dully. </p>

<p>"I can't give you any! I can't afford it!" slapped the Young
Doctor's brisk, cool voice. </p>

<p>"How many years can you sell me, then?" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>roused the woman with
the first faint red flare of vigor across her cheek bones. </p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," admitted the Young Doctor. Sagging back a
little wearily against the edge of the bureau, with his long
arms folded loosely across his breast he stood staring
tensely down through the woman's question into the actual
case itself. "Oh, I don't know," he admitted. "Oh, of course,
if you had some one brand-new interest to revitalize you? If
the matter of congenial climate could be properly adjusted?
With all your abundant financial resources? And all the extra
serenities and safeguards that financial resources can wrap a
sick person in? Oh, I suppose one could almost positively
guarantee you&mdash;guarantee you,&mdash;oh, years and years," he
finished a trifle vaguely. </p>

<p>"Only that?" winced the woman. "Years and years?" she quoted
mockingly. "It isn't enough! Not nearly enough!" she flared
with sudden passion. </p>

<p>"Even so," smiled the Young Doctor. "That is a more definite
estimate than I could, equally honestly, make for the youngest,
friskiest child who prances to work or play <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>every day through
the tortuous traffic of our city streets." </p>

<p>"Oh," said the woman with a flicker of humor in her tears. </p>

<p>"Oh," smiled the doctor without an atom of humor in the
smile. </p>

<p>With her handsome gray head cocked ever so slightly to one
side, the woman's eyes seemed rather oddly intent on the
Young Doctor for an instant. </p>

<p>"How&mdash;how thin you are&mdash;and how hungry-looking," she
commented suddenly with quite irrelevant impudence. </p>

<p>"Thank you," bowed the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Ha!" chuckled the woman. "And I? 'How satiate-looking she
is!' Is that what you'd like to say?" </p>

<p>"You are perfectly welcome to look any way you wish," said
the Young Doctor with distinct coldness. </p>

<p>Indifferently then for a moment both doctor and patient
seemed to relax into the centric personal hush of the sick-
room itself, with its far outlying murmur of thudding feet,
its occasional sharp, self-conscious click of remote elevator
machinery. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>

<p>Then the doctor snatched out his watch. </p>

<p>"Well, what is it you want me to do first?" roused the Sick
Woman instantly. </p>

<p>"Make your wish!" said the doctor. </p>

<p>"Yes, I know," parried the woman. "But what do you want me to
wish? What kind of a wish, I mean, do you want me to make?" </p>

<p>As though personally affronted by the question, the Young
Doctor stepped suddenly forward. </p>

<p>"What kind of a wish do I want you to make?" he demanded.
"Why, what kind of a wish should I want you to make except an
honest wish? Not the second-hand, sanctimonious, reconsidered
sort of wish that you think you ought to make. But the first
glad, self-concerned, self-revitalizing whim that gushes up
into your mind when anybody springs the word 'wish' at you!" </p>

<p>"Oh!" brightened the woman. "That ought to be easy enough."
The sudden smile flooding into the very faintly distorted
facial muscles gave a certain shrewd, waggish sort of humor
to the assertion. "Why not?" she persisted speculatively.
"Long life and happiness having been logically eliminated
from <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>my impulses, and both faith and fact having reasonably
convinced me that all my loved ones are perfectly well
provided for in either this world or the next, why shouldn't
I wish for the one thing that will add most to my own
personal diversion? Oh, very well," she began to consider.
Whitely her eyelids drooped down across her turbid eyes. "Now
you count ten, Doctor," she murmured quite casually. "And
when you say ten I'll tell you the wish." </p>

<p>"This isn't a game, Mrs. Gallien!" bristled the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>Very languidly the woman opened her eyes wide. </p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it?" she asked. "Then I won't wish, thank you." </p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" scolded the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"About getting well," conceded the woman. Languidly the white
eyelids closed again. "And if getting well isn't a game&mdash;I
won't get well, either," affirmed the woman. </p>

<p>With a gasp of irritation the Young Doctor snatched up his
hat and left the room. </p>

<p>But outside the door, neither up the hall nor down the hall,
nor across the hall, was the nurse waiting where he had told
her to wait. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<div class="center"><img src="images/2_oh_drat_you_women.jpg" alt="Oh, drat you women"/>
<div class="caption">"Oh, drat you women!" he grinned sheepishly. "Well, go
ahead! One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;TEN!"</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>



<p>With an audible imprecation he stalked back into the sick-
room and threw himself down into the first chair he could
reach. </p>

<p>"Oh, drat you women!" he grinned sheepishly. "Well, go ahead! One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten!"</p>

<p>As automatically almost as a mechanical doll the Sick Woman
opened her eyes. </p>

<p>"Oh, all right!" she smiled. "Now I will tell you the wish.
But first I must tell you that the thing I hate most in the
world is an empty twilight. And the thing I love best is a
crowded shop. Oh, the joy of shopping!" she quickened. "The
fun, the fury of it! Buy, buy, buy, while the light lasts and
the money shines! But as for the empty twilight?" she wilted
again. "I wish&mdash;" her voice caught suddenly, "I wish that the
last mail of the day may never leave me utterly letterless.
And that I may always be expecting a package by express!" </p>

<p>"Do you really mean it?" asked the Young <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>Doctor without the
slightest trace of perturbance. </p>

<p>"Why, of course I mean it!" smiled the woman. "But do you
dream for a moment that you can guarantee that?" </p>

<p>"I can at least prescribe it," said the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"You have more subtlety than I thought," drawled the woman. </p>

<p>"You have more simplicity than I had dared to hope," bowed
the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>Again, in shrewd half-mocking appraisement, the two measured
each other. </p>

<p>Then with a great, busy frown the Young Doctor turned to his
notebook. </p>

<p>"Let me see," he estimated. "It was four weeks ago yesterday&mdash;
that you fell on the street." </p>

<p>"Was it?" said the woman indifferently. </p>

<p>"Mrs. Gallien," asked the Young Doctor with some abruptness,
"just exactly where is your home?" </p>

<p>"I have no home," said the woman. </p>

<p>"Yes, but you must live somewhere," bristled the Young
Doctor. </p>

<p>"Only in my pocketbook and my sense of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>humor," quoted the
woman with frank mockery. </p>

<p>"But why make such a mystery about your domicile?" persisted
the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"That's just it," said the woman. "I haven't any domicile to
make a mystery of! It's seventeen years since I've lived in
what you call a domicile. </p>

<p>"Where have you lived?" demanded the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Oh, on steamers mostly," conceded the woman. Very faintly
the pallid nostrils dilated. "I've been to Australia five
times," she acknowledged. "And China twice. And Japan,&mdash;" she
quickened. "All the little vague outlying islands, all the
great jostling eager seaports! By steam, by paddle wheels, by
lax, loose-flapping rainbow-colored sails!" In sudden
listlessness she turned her cheek to the pillow again.
"Wherever the sea is salt," she murmured. "Wherever the sea
is salt! Hunting, always and forever hunting,&mdash;yes, that's
it,&mdash;always and forever hunting for lights and laughter and&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the Young Doctor, quite abruptly. "But is
your husband living?" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>

<p>"No," said the woman. "He died two years ago." </p>

<p>Inquisitively for a moment the Young Doctor studied the
nerve-ravaged face before him. </p>

<p>"Pardon me," he stammered. "But&mdash;but was it a great shock to
you?" </p>

<p>"It was a great relief," said the woman, without emotion. "He
had been hopelessly insane for seventeen years." </p>

<p>"Oh!" jumped the Young Doctor, as though the thought fairly
tortured his senses. </p>

<p>"Oh!" speculated the woman quizzically, with the merciful
outer callousness which the brain provides for those who are
obliged to carry some one scorching thought for an
indeterminate period of years. </p>

<p>As though in sheer nervous outlet the Young Doctor began
almost at once to pace the room. </p>

<p>"Seeing that there are no&mdash;no personal ties, apparently, to
hold you here&mdash;or drive you there," he said, "the matter of
congenial climate ought to be one that we can easily
arrange." <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>

<p>With half ironic amusement the Sick Woman lay and watched his
worried, fluctuating face. </p>

<p>"The question of climate is all arranged!" she said. "The
speed that was stripped from my body last week, has at least
been put back into my brain. Just where I am going, just whom
I am going to take with me, just what I am going to do to
amuse me, every last infinitesimal detail of all the rest of
my life," she smiled, "I have planned it all out while you
have been dawdling there between the wardrobe and the
bureau." </p>

<p>"Dawdling?" snapped the Young Doctor. Quite abruptly he
stopped his nervous pacing. "Well, where is it that you want
to go?" he asked. </p>

<p>Musingly the woman's eyes stared off again into the window-
framed vista of the city roofs. </p>

<p>"On an island," she said. "Off the coast of South Carolina
there is a house. It is really rather a dreadful old place. I
have not seen it since I was a girl. It was old then. It must
be almost a wreck now. And the island is not very large. And
there is no other house on the island. Just this great
rambling deserted shack. And six battered old live-oak trees
half strangled with dangly gray moss. And there are blue jays
always in the gray <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>moss, and cardinal birds, and unestimable
squirrels. And there is a bedroom in the house forty feet
long. And in that bedroom there is a four-poster seven feet
wide, and most weirdly devised of old ships' figureheads, a
smirking, faded siren at one corner, a broken-nosed sailor at
another,&mdash;I forget the others&mdash;but altogether in memory I see
it as a rather unusually broad and amusing shelf to be laid
aside on. And there, in the middle of that great ship-figured
bed, in the middle of that great dingy sunken-cabin sort of
room with its every ancient windowpane blearing grayly into
the sea, through deck-like porches so broad, so dark, so
glowering that no streak of cloud or sky will ever reach my
eyes again, nor any strip of gray-brown earth&mdash;I shall lie, I
say, in unutterable peace and tranquillity as other ghosts
have lain before me, 'forty fathoms deep' below all their
troubles. And always as I lie thus, there will be the sigh of
the surf in my ears. And the swell of the tide in my eyes.
Eternally across my windows fin-like wings shall soar and
pass and gray mosses float and flare." </p>

<p>"Cheerful!" snapped the Young Doctor. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>

<p>"Yes. Isn't it?" beamed the woman. </p>

<p>With a gasp of surprise the Young Doctor turned and stared at
her. </p>

<p>"Why, I really believe that you think so!" he stammered. </p>

<p>"Why, of course I think so!" said the Woman. "Why not?" she
queried. "A dimming candle glows brightest in a dark room!"
Not a trace of morbidness was in her voice, not a flicker of
sentimentality. "And besides," she smiled. "It is also my
desire to remove myself as far as possible from the main
thoroughfares of life." </p>

<p>"I don't see why!" protested the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"This is the 'why,'" said the woman. "Just as I fell that
day," she smiled. "In my last conscious moment, I mean,&mdash;a
hurrying child stumbled and stepped on me." Once again the
smile twisted ever so slightly to one side. "And never any
more while I live," said the woman, "do I care to repeat the
sensation of being an impediment to traffic." Very idly for a
moment she seemed to focus her entire interest on the
flapping window curtain. "And I shall name my <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>house&mdash;name my
house&mdash;" she mused. With sudden impetuous conviction every
lax muscle of her face tightened into action. "Once&mdash;once in
New England," she hurried, "I saw a scarlet-gold tulip named
'Glare of the Garden'! For absolute antithesis I shall call
my house 'Gloom of the Sea!'" </p>

<p>"Do you wish to take your present young nurse with you?"
asked the doctor a bit abruptly. </p>

<p>The crooked smile on the woman's face straightened instantly
into thin-lipped positiveness. </p>

<p>"I do not!" said the woman. "I detest novices! Their
professional affectations drive me mad! I am born, weaned,
educated, courted, married, widowed,&mdash;crippled, in the
moppish time it takes them to wash my face, to straighten the
simplest fork on my breakfast tray! Every gesture of their
bodies, every impulse of their minds, fairly creak with the
laborious, studied arrogance of an immature nature thrust
suddenly into authority! If I've got to have personal service
all the rest of my days for goodness' sake give me a big,
experienced nature reduced by some untoward <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>reason to the
utmost terms of simplicity!" As quickly as it had come, the
irritation vanished from her face. "There is a chambermaid
here in this hotel&mdash;I love her!" said the woman. "She was a
hospital superintendent somewhere, once, until her deafness
smashed it." As ingenuously as a child's the tired, worldly-
wise eyes lifted to the Young Doctor's face. "I like deaf
people," said the woman. "They never chatter, I have noticed.
Nor insist upon reading the newspapers to you. Being
themselves protected from every vocal noise that does not
directly concern them, they seem instinctively to accord you
the same sacristy. And besides," smiled the woman, "this ex-
superintendent's hair is as gray as mine. And I adore women
whose hair is just exactly as gray as mine. And also," smiled
the woman, "her name happens to be 'Martha'&mdash;and I have
always craved the personal devotion of someone named
'Martha'. And I shall pay her an extra hundred dollars a
month," smiled the woman, "to call me 'Elizabeth'. Never in
my life," said the woman, "have I ever had any food cooked
for my first name. Martha <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>will do everything for me, you
understand?" she added quickly. </p>

<p>"Yes, but how do you know that she'll go with you?" asked the
Young Doctor dryly. </p>

<p>"How do I know that she'll go with me?" flared the woman. The
imperious consciousness of money was in the flare, but also
the subtler surety of a temperamental conviction. "Why, of
course she'll go!" said the woman. As definitely as though
she had assumed that sunshine would be sunshine, she
dismissed the whole topic from their conversation. </p>

<p>"Oh, all right," smiled the Young Doctor a bit ironically. "I
am to infer then that climate, locality, care, companionship,
everything has been arranged except your wish for a chronic
Package by Express?" </p>

<p>"Oh, that is all arranged too!" boasted the woman. </p>

<p>"I don't see it," said the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"I saw it," said the woman, "while you were straightening
your necktie! Oh, of course, the shops can never happen
again." She winced with real emotion. "All the gay, covetous
fingering of silk or bronze, the shrewd explorative sallies
through aisles of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>treasure and tiers of tantalization! But
just the package part?" She rallied instantly. "Oh, the
package part I assure you is perfectly easy, as long as
memory lasts and imagination holds. With a check book on one
side of me and a few dollars worth of postage stamps on the
other, all I'll have to do," she laughed, "is just to lie
there on my back and study the advertising pages of all the
magazines. Every fascinating gown that cries for help from a
fashion catalogue! Every irresistible lawn mower that brags
of its prowess from the columns of an agricultural journal!
Ten cent packages of floral miracles, or ten dollar lotions
from the beauty shops! Certainly never again till the end of
time ought there to dawn a day when I haven't a reasonable
right to expect that something will arrive! </p>

<p>"And I shall have a wrangle boat, of course," babbled the
woman impishly. "What is it? Oh, 'motor boat' you call it?
Oh, any old kind of an engine,&mdash;I don't care, so long as it
serves its purpose of keeping a man and a boy busy all day
long quarreling as they always do just how to run it. And
once a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>day, every late afternoon, I shall send the wrangle
boat to the mainland&mdash;way&mdash;way out beyond the sky line of my
piazza. And the instant that boat swings back into vision
again, just between the droop of the roof and the lift of the
railing, they will hoist a flag if there is anything for me.
And if there isn't&mdash;if there isn't?" Across her whimsical
prophecy indescribable irritation settled suddenly. "And if
there isn't anything, they need never return!" snapped the
woman. </p>

<p>"Oh, of course, that's all right at first," mocked the Young
Doctor. "But in your original description of your island I
remember no mention of large storehouses or empty warerooms.
After a while you know, with things arriving every day or so.
And the house, I infer, except for the one big room you speak
of, sustains no special acreage." </p>

<p>"Stupid!" rallied the woman. </p>

<p>"Oh, I see," puzzled the Young Doctor. "You&mdash;you mean that
you're going to give the things away? Hordes of young nieces,
and poor relations and all that sort of thing? Why&mdash;why, of
course!" </p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said the woman. With suddenly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>narrowing eyes her
whole face turned incalculably shrewd and cold. "Oh, no! I am
all through giving anything away!" Defiantly for an instant
she challenged the Young Doctor's silence, then sank back
with frank indifference into her pillows again. "Worldly as I
am," she smiled very faintly, "and worldly as my father and
mother were before me, and their father and mother,
doubtless, before them, there is one little prayer that I
shall never forget,&mdash;and I found it, if the fact interests
you, inscribed painstakingly in faded violet ink in the back
of my grandfather's first check book, before, evidently,
either wealth or worldliness had quite begun to set in. And
this is the little prayer: </p>

<p>"If fortune and finance should so ordain that I may never be
any kind of a giver, Heaven grant that at least I may not be
a stingy receiver but share unstintedly with such benefactor
as may favor me the exceeding happiness which his benefaction
has most surely conferred upon me!" </p>

<p>Once more the faint smile twisted into cynicism. "That's it,"
said the woman. "I'm tired of <i>stingy receivers!</i>" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid I don't get you," said the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Don't you ever get anything?" snapped the woman explosively. </p>

<p>It was the Young Doctor's turn to flare now. "Oh, yes," he
said. "Sometimes I get awfully tired of the vagaries of
women!" </p>

<p>Out of her nerves rather than her mirth the woman burst out
laughing. </p>

<p>"You are so young!" she said. </p>

<p>"Not as juvenile as your vagaries," protested the Young
Doctor. </p>

<p>"But my vagaries are not juvenile!" insisted the woman. "They
are as old and ingrained as time itself. For seventeen
years," quickened the woman, "I have been 'gathering gifts'
from all over the world, ripping things out of impersonal
wholesale, as it were, to apply them as best I might to this
person's, or the other's, individual need. Say, if you want
to, that I have had nothing else to do on my travels except
to spend money, yet the fact remains that as far as my own
personal satisfactions are concerned in the matter of giving,
I have been pouring presents for seventeen years into a
bottomless pit. Never once, I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span> mean," smiled the woman, "never
once, yearning over the abyss as the gift went down, have I
ever heard the entrancing thud that a gift ought to make when
it lands on real appreciation. Never!" </p>

<p>"Well, you are a cynic!" conceded the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"I admit it," said the woman. "Yet even a cynic may be fair-
minded." For the first time in her tired, sophisticated face,
shrewdness and irony were equally routed by sheer perplexity.
"I've thought it all out as decently as I could from the
other person's point of view," she puzzled. "I see his side,
I think. I have no legal, constitutional right, of course, to
demand a person's gratitude for any gift which is purely
voluntary on my part. Lots of people in all probability would
infinitely rather not have a gift than be obliged thereby to
write a 'Thank you' for it. Against such a person's wish and
inclination, I mean, I've no right to pry 'Thank you's' out
of him, even with gold-mounted golf sticks or first editions.
I've no right to be a highwayman, I mean. Even if I'm
literally dying for a 'Thank you' I've no more right, I mean,
to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>hold up a person with a gift than I'd have to hold him up
with a gun." </p>

<p>"Then what are you fussing about?" asked the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"I'm fussing about the hatefulness of it," said the woman.
All the shrewdness came suddenly back to her face. "This is
what I mean!" she cried sharply. "When I stay in Paris three
months, for instance, to collect a trousseau for the daughter
of a man who meant something to me once in my youth, and
receive in due time from that girl a single page of gothic
handwriting thanking me no matter how gushingly for my
'magnificent gift,' I tell you I could fairly kill her for
her stingy receiving! Not a word from her about hats, you
understand? Not a comment on shoes! Not the vaguest, remotest
mention of chiffon veils, silk stockings, evening gowns,
street suits, mink furs, anything! Just the whole outfit,
trunk after trunk of 'em, all lumped in together and
dismissed perfectly casually under the lump word 'gift!' and
it wasn't just a 'gift' that I gave her, you understand?"
said the woman with a sudden real twinge of emotion. "Almost
nobody, you know, ever <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>gives just a 'gift.' What I really
gave her, of course, was three whole months of my taste,
time, temperament! Three whole months of my wanting-to-give!
Three whole months of a woman's dreams for a young girl! What
I really gave her, of course, was the plaudits of her elders,
the envies of all her girl chums, the new, unduplicatable
pride and dignity of a consciously perfect equipment! What I
really gave her, of course, was the light in her bridegroom's
eyes when he first saw her merge a throb of mist and pearls
through the gray gloom of the cathedral chancel! What I
really gave her of course was the&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"Yes, but you surely know that she appreciated the gift,"
deprecated the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Why, of course she appreciated the gift!" snapped the woman.
"But what I'm trying to find is some one who'd appreciate the
giver! Anybody can appreciate a gift," she added with
unprecedented scorn. "Pleased?" snapped the woman. "Why, of
course, she was pleased! The only thing I'm fussing about is
that she was too stingy to share her pleasure <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>with me! The
fire I worked so hard to light, lit all right, but simply
refused to warm me! That's it! Why! Did she note by one
single extra flourish of her pen that the lining of her opera
cloak was like the petalling of a pink Killarney rose? Or
that the texture of her traveling suit would have made a
princess strut with pride? When she lumped a dozen Paris hats
into the one word 'nice' did she dream for one single instant
that she had lulled my perfectly human hunger to know whether
it was the red one or the green one or the gold which most
became her ecstatic little face? Did it ever occur to her to
tell me what her lover said about the gay little brown
leather hunting suit? Six months hence, freezing to death in
some half-heated palace on the Riviera, is there one chance
in ten thousand, do you think, that she will write me to say,
'Oh, you darling, how did you ever happen to think of a
moleskin breakfast coat and footies?' And again!" scolded the
woman. "When a stodgy old missionary on his way back to
Africa relaxes enough on a mid-ocean moonlight night so that
it's fun a month later to send him a mule and cart just to
keep his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>faithful, clumsy old feet off the African sands, do
you think it's fun for him to send me eight smug laborious
pages complimenting me&mdash;without a moon in them,&mdash;on 'the
great opportunities for doing good which my enormous wealth
must give me,' and commending me specially 'for this most
recent account of my stewardship which I have just evidenced
in my noble gift'?" For one single illuminating flash humor
twitched back into the woman's eyebrow. "Stewardship&mdash;bosh!"
she confided. "On a picture post card&mdash;with stubby, broken-
nosed pencil&mdash;I would so infinitely rather he had scribbled,
'Bully for you, Old Girl! This is some mule!'" </p>

<p>With a little sigh of fatigue she sank back into her pillows.
"'More blessed to give than to receive?' Quite evidently!"
she said. "Everywhere it's the same! People love pictures and
never note who painted them! People love stories and never
remember who wrote them! Why, in any shop in this city," she
roused, "I wager you could go in and present a hundred dollar
bill to the seediest old clerk you saw&mdash;and go back in an
hour and he wouldn't know you by sight! 'The gift without <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>the
giver is bare?'" she quoted savagely. "Ha! What they really
meant was 'The giver added to the gift is a bore?'" </p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose to do about it?" quizzed the Young
Doctor a bit impatiently. </p>

<p>"I propose to do this about it!" said the woman. "I propose
to become a reformer!" </p>

<p>"A reformer?" jeered the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;an avenger! if you like the word better,"
conceded the woman. "Oh, I shall keep right on buying things,
of course," she hastened mockingly to assure him. "And giving
things, of course. One could hardly break so suddenly the
habit and vice of a life time. Only I shan't scatter my shots
all over the lot any more. But concentrate my deadliest aim
on one single individual. Indeed, I think I shall advertise,"
mocked the woman. "In that amazing column of all daily papers
so misleadingly labeled 'wants' instead of able-to-haves I
shall insert some sort of a statement to the effect that: </p>

<p>"An eccentric middle-aged woman of fabulous wealth, lavish
generosity, and no common sense whatsoever, will receive into
her 'lovely Southern <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span> Home' one stingy receiver. Strictest
reference required. Object: Reformation or&mdash;annihilation." </p>

<p>"It would be interesting to see the answers you'd get!"
rallied the Young Doctor with unwonted playfulness. </p>

<p>Almost imperceptibly the woman twisted her eyebrows. "Oh, of
course, I admit that most of them would be from asylums," she
said. "Offering me special rates. But there's always a
chance, of course, that&mdash;that&mdash;" Straight as a pencil-ruling
both eyebrows dropped suddenly into line. "But I'm quite used
to taking chances, thank you!" she finished with exaggerated
bruskness. </p>

<p>"What else do you propose to take?" asked the Young Doctor a
bit dryly. </p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" said the woman. </p>

<p>At the edge of the bureau the Young Doctor wheeled abruptly
in his tracks. </p>

<p>"Well, you won t!" he said. His face was quite white with
anger. </p>

<p>"Why not?" drawled the woman. As ruthlessly as a child she
seemed to be estimating suddenly the faintly perceptible
shine of the man's shoulder seams. Only the frankness of the
stare relieved it of its <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>insolence. "Why not?" she said. "Is
your practice here so huge that you can totally afford to
ignore a salary such as I would give you?" </p>

<p>"Nevertheless," winced the Young Doctor, "even <i>you</i> cannot
buy everything!" </p>

<p>"Can't I?" smiled the woman. In passionate willfulness and
pride her smile straightened out again into its thin-lipped
line. "But I need you!" she asserted arrogantly. "I like you!
If I had had my choice of every practitioner in the city, I&mdash;
I!" With a precipitous whimper of nerves the tears began
suddenly to stream down her cheeks. "There is&mdash;there is
something about you," she stammered. "In a&mdash;in a trolley car
accident, in a steamer panic, out of a&mdash;out of a thousand,"
she sobbed, "I instinctively would have turned to you!" As
abruptly as it had come, the flood of tears vanished from her
face, leaving instead a gray-streaked flicker of incredulity.
"Why, I don't even know how I did happen to get you!" she
admitted aghast. "Out of all the doctors in the city&mdash;it must
have been intended! It must! If there's any Providence at all
it must arrange <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span> such details! How did I happen to get you?"
she demanded imperiously. </p>

<p>For the first time across the Young Doctor's lean, ascetic
face an expression of relaxation quickened. </p>

<p>"Well if you really want to know," he said. "As you were
being lifted out of your carriage at the hotel door, I was
just coming out of the Free Lunch&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"Hunger or thirst?" scoffed the woman. </p>

<p>"None of your business," smiled the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Oh, and besides," rallied the woman instantly. "I thought,
likely as not, that there might be some girl. Somebody you
could coach! About my passion for shopping, I mean! I don't
care who gets the things! If there's anybody you like, she
might just as well be the one!" </p>

<p>"Thank you," rebristled the Young Doctor. "But I don't happen
to know any girls!" </p>

<p>"Good enough!" said the woman. "Then there's nothing at all
to complicate your coming!" </p>

<p>"But I'm not coming!" stared the Young Doctor. The pupils of
his eyes were dilated <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>like a deer's jacked suddenly with an
infuriating light. </p>

<p>"But you are coming," said the woman without a flicker of
emotion. "Day after tomorrow it is. At three-thirty from the
Pennsylvania Station." </p>

<p>"I'm not!" said the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"You are!" said the woman. </p>

<p>When it comes right down to the matter of statistics, just
how many times in your life you've had your own way and just
how many times you haven't, Mrs. Tome Gallien was not
exaggerating when she boasted to the Young Doctor that she
was quite in the habit of having her own way. She certainly
was! In the majority of incidents she had, indeed, always had
her own way. And in the majority of incidents she had her own
way now. That is to say, that the South Carolina train did
leave the Pennsylvania Station at just exactly the time she
said it would. And Martha the deaf was on that train. And
she, herself, was on that train. </p>

<p>But the Young Doctor was not. </p>

<p>"Not much! <i>Not much!</i>" was the way the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>Young Doctor said it,
if you really want to know. </p>

<p>But he said very little else that afternoon. To be perfectly
frank his luncheon had been very poor, and his breakfast,
before that, and his dinner, before that. Further reiteration
would be purely monotonous. Moreover, on this particular
February day the weather was extravagantly Northern, his
office, as cold and dark and bleak as some untenanted back
alley, and his general professional prospects as dull as, if
not indeed duller than, the last puff of ashes in his pipe.
Yet even so he counted his situation ecstasy compared to the
thought of being dragged South by the wrapper-strings of a
gray-haired invalid-woman as headstrong as she was body-weak.
"Not much!" Long after there was no tugging warm taste left
in his pipe he was still tugging at the phrase. "Not much!" </p>

<p>But Mrs. Tome Gallien on her fine train scudding South was
even more chary of words than he when it came to her own
comment on his defection. </p>

<p>"Idjot!" she telegraphed back from Washington. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span> </p>

<p>The operator who repeated the message over the telephone was
frankly apologetic. </p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor," explained the metallic voice. "That's just
exactly the way we received it. It isn't even 'idiot'" argued
the voice. "Because we wired back for verification. 'I-d-j-o-t!'
That's what it is. Maybe it's a&mdash;a code word," condoned the voice
amiably. </p>

<p>It certainly was a "code" word. And the message that it
sought to convey was plainly this: </p>

<p>"How any young struggling practitioner in a strange city,
with not only his future to make but even his present, how
such a one has got the nerve, the nerve, I say, to refuse a
regular salaried position and all expenses, all expenses,
mind you, in a salubrious climate, and with a lady,&mdash;well,
with a lady whom other men infinitely wiser and more
sophisticated than he have not found utterly devoid perhaps
of interest and charm?" </p>

<p>Talk about being packed "cram-jam?" Surely no week-end
suitcase could ever have bulged more with significance than
did this one tiny telegram "Idjot!" And equally surely its
context "dressed" the Young Doctor's <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>mind quite completely
for almost a week. </p>

<p>But the great square white envelope that arrived in due time
from Mrs. Tome Gallien had nothing in it at all except a
check. No reproaches, I mean, no upbraidings, no convalescent
rhapsodies of gratitude even. Just a plain straightforward
unsentimental black and white check covering so many
professional visits at so much a visit. A man might have sent
it. A perfectly well man, I mean. </p>

<p>"And so the episode ends," mused the Young Doctor with
distinct satisfaction. </p>

<p>But it didn't end so, of course. Women like Mrs. Tome Gallien
were not created to end things but to start 'em. Of such is
the kingdom of Leaven. </p>

<p>It was on the following Thursday that the grand piano arrived
at the Young Doctor's office. </p>

<p>Now the Young Doctor's office might easily have accommodated
more patients than it did. But piano movers are almost always
so fat. Puffing, blowing, swearing, tugging,&mdash;the whole dingy
room seemed suddenly packed with brawn. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>

<p>"But it isn't my piano!" protested the Young Doctor from
every chair, desk, table, of his ultimate retreat. "It
<i>isn't</i> my piano!" he yelled from the doorway. "It isn't my
piano!" he scolded through the window. </p>

<p>But it was his piano, of course! The piano movers swore that
it was. The piano warerooms telephoned that it was. . . Worst
of all, the piano itself on one plump ankle flaunted a tag
which proclaimed that it was. And the proclamation was most
distinctly in Mrs. Tome Gallien's handwriting. </p>

<p>"For Dr. Sam Kendrue," it said. "As a slight token of my
appreciation and esteem." </p>

<p>"'Appreciation?'" groaned the Young Doctor. "'Esteem?'" In the
first venom of his emotion he sat right down and wrote Mrs.
Gallien just exactly what he thought of her. And of it. "It"
being of course the piano. </p>

<p>"Whatever in the world," he demanded, "would I do with a
piano? Oh, of course it's very kind of you and all that," he
conceded with crass sarcasm. "But I have no possible floor
space, you understand, beyond my office and the very meager
bedroom adjoining it. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>And with a quarter of a ton's worth of
wood and wire plunked down thus in the exact center of my
office it leaves me, I assure you, an extraordinarily limited
amount of elbow-space unless it be a sort of running track
that still survives around the extreme edges of the room. And
moreover the piano is of rosewood, as you doubtless already
know, and all inlaid with cherubim and seraphim snarled up in
wreaths of lavender roses. Now Botany I admit, is distinctly
out of my line. But the cherubim and seraphim are certainly
very weird anatomically. </p>

<p>"And not knowing one note from another,&mdash;as indeed I remember
telling you quite plainly at an earlier date, well,&mdash;excuse
me if I seem harsh," he exploded all over again, "but
whatever in the world would I do with a piano?" </p>

<p>As ingenuously insolent as a child's retort came Mrs. Tome
Gallien's almost immediate reply. </p>

<p>"Yes! What would you do? That's just exactly it! I thought
I'd get a rise out of you!" said Mrs. Tome Gallien. "Across
my dulled horizon a whole heap of most diverting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>speculations
have suddenly begun to flash and brighten. 'Whatever in the
world' <i>would</i> you do with a piano?" </p>

<p>"I can at least return it to the warerooms," wrote the Young
Doctor with significant brevity. </p>

<p>"Oh, no, you can't!" telegraphed Mrs. Tome Gallien. "Apropos
slight defect and large mark-down merchandise rated non-
returnable." </p>

<p>While he was yet fuming over this message Mrs. Tome Gallien's
special delivery letter overtook her telegram. </p>

<p>"Don't struggle," urged Mrs. Tome Gallien. "After all, my
dear young antagonist, when it comes right down to brass
tacks, it isn't so much a question of just what you are going
to do with the piano as it is of&mdash;just what the piano is
going to do with you. Because of course, do something it
certainly will! And the madder you get of course the more it
will do! And the madder you get of course the sooner it will
do it! And&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, lying here flat on my back in all this damp, salty, sea-
green stillness,&mdash;tides coming, tides going,&mdash;sands
shifting,&mdash;sea-weeds <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>floating,&mdash;my whole wild heedless Past
resolves itself into one single illuminating conviction. It's
the giving people appropriate gifts that stultifies their
characters so, pampering their vanities, and clogging alike
both their impulses and their ink! Yes, sir! </p>

<p>"Why, goodness, Man! If I had crocheted you slippers would it
have joggled you one iota out of the rut of your daily life?
Or would even the latest design in operating tables have
quickened one single heart-beat of your snug, self-sufficient
young body? Or for forty stethoscopes do you imagine for one
tiny instant that you would have written me twice in five
days? </p>

<p>"But if one can only make a person mad instead of glad! Now
that's the real kindness! So invigorating! So educative! So
poignantly reconstructive! Because if there's one shining
mark in the world that Adventure loves it's a&mdash;shining mad
person. Even you, for instance! Having made no place in your
particular rut for 'quarter of a ton of wood and wire' the
advent of such a weightage is just plain naturally bound to
crowd you out of your rut. And whoever side-steps his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>rut for
even an instant? Well, truly, I think you deserved just a wee
bit of crowding. </p>

<p>"So Heigho, Cross Laddie! And rustle round as fast as you can
to get yourself a new necktie or a hair-cut or a shine!
'Cause something certainly is going to happen to you! Happen
right off, I mean! Even now perhaps! Even&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>With a grunt of disgust the Young Doctor jumped up and began
to pace his office,&mdash;what was left of his office, I mean,
around the extreme edges of the room. And the faster he paced
the madder he grew. </p>

<p>"Oh, the fantasia of women!" he stormed. "The&mdash;the
exaggeration!" </p>

<p>He was perfectly right&mdash;Mrs. Tome Gallien was often
fantastic, and certainly quite exaggerative anent the present
situation. </p>

<p>The threatened "adventure" did not happen at once! It didn't
happen indeed for at least two hours! </p>

<p>Yet the fact remains, of course, that the big piano was at
the bottom of the adventure. Science no doubt would have
refuted the connection. But Fancy is no such fool. Surely <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>if
there hadn't been a big piano the Young Doctor would never
have worked himself up into such a bad temper on that
particular afternoon. And if he hadn't worked himself up into
such a bad temper he never would have flounced himself out
into the dreary February streets to try and "walk it off."
And if he hadn't tried so hard to "walk it off" he never
would have developed such a perfectly ravenous hunger. And if
he hadn't developed such a perfectly ravenous hunger he never
would have bolted at just exactly six o'clock for the
brightest lighted restaurant in sight. And it was on the
street right in front of the brightest lighted restaurant
that the adventure happened. </p>

<p>Even Fancy, though, would never have boasted that it was
anything except a very little adventure. Skies didn't fall, I
mean, nor walls topple, nor bags of gold roll gaily to the
Young Doctor's feet. Just a car stopped,&mdash;a great plain,
clumsy everyday electric car, and from the front platform of
it a girl with a suitcase in one hand, a hat box in the
other, and goodness-knows-what tucked under one elbow, jumped
down into the mud. </p>

<p>Even so the adventure would never have <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>started if the
goodness-knows-what hadn't slipped suddenly from the girl's
elbow and exploded all over the street into a goodness-knows-
how-many! It would have been funny of course if it hadn't
been so clumsy. But even while deprecating the digital
clumsiness of women, the Young Doctor leaped instinctively to
the rescue. There were certainly enough things that needed
rescuing! Toys they proved to be. And such a scattering! A
brown plush coon under the wheels of a stalled automobile! A
flamboyant red-paper rose bush trampled to pulp beneath a
cart horse's hoofs! A tin steam engine cackling across a
hobbly brick sidewalk! A green-feathered parrot disappearing
all too quickly in a fox terrier's mouth! A doll here! A
paint box there! And the girl herself standing perfectly
helpless in the midst of it all blushing twenty shades of
pink and still hanging desperately tight to the leather
suitcase in one hand and the big hat box in the other. </p>

<p>"And it isn't at all that I am so&mdash;so stupid!" she kept
explaining hectically. "But it is that when an accident
occurs so in English I cannot think in English what to do! If
I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>put down my suitcase!" she screamed, "a dog will bite it!
And if I drop my box a trample might get it!" </p>

<p>It was not until the Young Doctor had succeeded in
reassembling owner and articles on the safe edge of the
curbing that he noticed for the first time how tall the girl
was and how shiningly blonde. "Altogether too tall and too
blonde to behave like such an idiot!" he argued perfectly
illogically. With a last flare of courtesy he sought to end
the incident. "Were you going to take another car?" He
gestured toward her crowded hands. </p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the girl with a wave of her hat box. "I was
going to that restaurant over there." </p>

<p>"Why so was I," said the Young Doctor very formally. "So if
you wish I will take your suitcase for you. That will at
least help a little." </p>

<p>Without further parleying they crossed the snowy street and
still all a-blow and a-glow with the wintry night bore down
upon the snug little restaurant like two young guests of the
north wind. In fact as well as effect the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>room was brightly
crowded and seemed to flare up like a furnace blast into
their own chilled faces. A trifle dazzled by the glare
perhaps they faltered suddenly in their tracks. For one
single conspicuous instant,&mdash;blonde as the moon, swarth as a
pine tree's shadow,&mdash;they stood staring helplessly here,
there, everywhere into a blur of frankly upturned faces. Then
without an atom's warning a lone woman at the small table
just in front of them jumped to her feet. </p>

<p>"Why, of course, you poor dears!" she beamed. "You want to
get seats together!" And fled, still beaming, to the one
remaining vacant seat at a far table in the corner. </p>

<p>A graven image could scarcely have helped grinning at the
absurdity of the incident. And the Young Doctor was by no
means a graven image. As for the girl, she giggled out right,
and with an impulse scarcely American pulled out the Young
Doctor's chair for him before she, herself, darted down into
the more crumpled place which the other woman had just
vacated. "After all," she conceded shruggingly, "it is not of
such a consequence!" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>Only the flaming color in her cheeks
belied her nonchalance. </p>

<p>With his left hand reaching for the menu and his right hand
exploring his pockets, the Young Doctor sought to show that
he also was perfectly nonchalant. </p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's been a&mdash;a very cold day, hasn't it?" he essayed
experimentally. </p>

<p>From her own frowning contemplation of the card before her
the girl lifted her amazingly blue eyes. </p>

<p>"No-o," she said. "I think the chicken soup would be more of
a taste than the bouillon." </p>

<p>"What I remarked," persisted the Young Doctor, "was that the
weather&mdash;the weather&mdash;" With his right hand still in his
pocket, a most curious expression of shock passed suddenly
over his face. His pocketbook was gone! Quite desperately he
studied the distance to the telephone booth, the quickest
path to the door,&mdash;any direction, any excuse that would
snatch him soonest out of the horrid predicament of finding
himself penniless at a perfectly strange restaurant in the
company of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>a perfectly strange girl. Yet if he did bolt thus
without explanation, as was certainly his most immediate
impulse, what possible inference could the girl draw, except
something crudely harsh and derogatory to her own frankly
guileless personality. With a quite unwonted flush at his
cheek bones he decided to make explanations. "Excuse me," he
grinned with a sharp edging back of his chair, "but it will
not be my pleasure after all to&mdash;to sample the chicken soup
with you. Some mutt back there&mdash;while I was picking up those
cursed toys&mdash;" Quite frantically again he began to rummage
through all his pockets. "Some mutt has pinched my
pocketbook," he finished perfectly simply. </p>

<p>"What?" cried the girl. "What?" With her eyes still staring
blue and wide, she reached out a slim, strong detaining hand
to his sleeve. "You mean that you cannot thus have any
supper?" she frowned. "And the night also so dark and so
cold? Why, what nonsense!" she beamed suddenly. "I have
moneys to drown! No? Is it 'to burn' that you say?" she
corrected herself. And thrust her own purse at him.
Chucklingly like <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>a child she began to rock herself to and
fro. "Certainly it is all of a very great fatedness!" she
reveled. "First you pick up my shoppings for me! And now it
is that I pick up your supper for you! What? No?" she
stammered as the Young Doctor quite curtly refused the purse
and rose very definitely to his feet. Across the translucent
blondness of her upturned face astonishment, incredulity,
glowered suddenly like a dark shadow. "What? No? Is it then
so correct?" she protested. "Is it kind? Is it senselike?
That for so small a trifle you should&mdash;'snub' is it that you
say, a stranger in a strange land? Certainly it was not of my
boldness," she quickened. "But of the boldness of that
demented woman yonder, that I sit here!" Then as suddenly as
it had come all the shadow vanished from her face leaving
just laughter again and a vaguely provocative sort of
challenge. "Oh, go if it seems most best to be of such a
silliness!" she said. "But if you go I shall certainly laugh!
Laugh with loudness, I mean! Right out! And like this, with
the handles of my knife and fork," she threatened to
illustrate, "I will beat upon the table while <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>I laugh! Bah!"
she gesticulated encouragingly towards the deserted chair,
"What is the price of a supper between two gentlemans?" </p>

<p>"Oh, of course, if you feel like that!" conceded the Young
Doctor as he slipped back into his seat. "Quite frankly," he
admitted, "I should hate to be even the innocent cause of
your beating upon the table with the handles of your knife
and fork. So if you really and truly think I look honest," he
confided with an exaggerated resumption of interest in the
bill of fare. "Let me see. Sixty cents, is it? And the tip?
And two cents for a postage stamp? Yes, I surely ought to be
able to return that much by at least noon to-morrow." Without
a flicker of expression he lifted his dark eyes to hers. </p>

<p>Without a flicker of expression she resumed the conversation
at the exact point apparently where she had been most
reluctant to leave it off. </p>

<p>"And so," she brightened. "After the chicken soup, would it
not seem to you, for instance, that turkey would be
infinitely more chic than&mdash;than corned beef?" </p>

<p>Quite regardless of his possible negative she <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>turned quickly
and summoned a heavy-faced waitress to her. </p>

<p>"Behold it is now a dinner party!" she confided blithely to
the perfectly indifferent woman. "The soup, the turkey, the
best of your salads, the blackest of your coffee! Everything
very chic!" </p>

<p>"Very what?" queried the waitress. </p>

<p>"Very quick!" interposed the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>Once again without a flicker of expression the dark eyes and
the blue challenged each other across the narrow width of
white table cloth. </p>

<p>Then the owner of the blue eyes reached out and drained her
glass of ice water at a single draught. </p>

<p>"Ah!" she shivered. "I also am in more hurry than you. But it
would not seem to me polite to nag about it." </p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," stammered the Young Doctor, and
retreated in turn to his own glass of ice water. It was not
until the soup course was almost over that he succumbed to
any further conversational impulse, and even then indeed it
was formality rather than <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>sociability that drove him to the
effort. "Seeing that you are so kind," he succeeded in
enunciating. "And so&mdash;so trusting," he relaxed ever so
slightly, "the least I can do certainly is to identify
myself. My name is Sam Kendrue. And I am a doctor." </p>

<p>"So-o?" conceded the girl without enthusiasm. Quite frankly
she made it clear that the waitress approaching with the
turkey was the only fact in the world that concerned her at
that immediate moment. Yet as one who would conscientiously
acknowledge on second thought that no honest bit of
information was ever really to be scoffed at, she laid down
her knife and fork presently and surveyed the Young Doctor
with a slightly reviving interest. "Sam? Sam Kendrue?" she
repeated painstakingly. "My name is Solvei Kjelland!" she
announced with brisk matter-of-factness, and resumed her
eating. </p>

<p>"Your name is&mdash;what?" puzzled the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Solvei Kjelland," she smiled ever so faintly. "S-o-l-v-e-i,"
she spelled out as one quite familiarly accustomed to such a
task. "K-j-e-l-l-a-n-d. I am a Norwegian!" she <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span> flared up
suddenly with the ecstatic breathlessness of one who confides
a really significant surprise. </p>

<p>"A Norwegian?" rallied the Young Doctor. For the first time,
behind the quick shield of his hand, a little teasing smile
began to twitch. "Really, you&mdash;you surprise me!" he recovered
with an almost instantly forced gravity. "From your accent
now, I had supposed all along that you were&mdash;er&mdash;Celtic!" </p>

<p>"Celtic?" queried the girl. Then with one shrewd glance at
the Young Doctor's immobile face she burst out laughing. It
was not a loud laugh. It was indeed a very little laugh, and
most distinctly musical. But in that instant the whole
attention of the room seemed to focus itself suddenly on that
one helpless little table. </p>

<p>"Is there anything specially peculiar looking about us, I
wonder?" bristled the Young Doctor. "Or rather, about me, I
should say?" he corrected himself quickly. "Even that&mdash;that
philanthropic woman," he fumed, "who vacated this table for
us! Well, of course I wouldn't say exactly that she was
climbing up on the rungs of her chair, but&mdash;&mdash;" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing," said the girl with unruffled
nonchalance. "She's been staring at us all of the evening.
Everybody's been staring at us all of the evening," she added
amiably. Very daintily, but none the less expeditiously, as
she spoke, she began to turn her attention to the crisp green
salad at her plate. "It is because we are both so tall and
fine," she confided without an atom of self-consciousness. </p>

<p>"Oh, well, really, speak for yourself!" flushed the Young
Doctor. </p>

<p>"For myself?" she repeated a bit speculatively. Once again,
in a moment of temporary arrestment, she laid down her knife
and fork to scrutinize the Young Doctor's face. "Oh, no," she
reassured him almost at once. "You are most tall and fine
too! And so brune to my blonde!" she confided as she took up
her fork again. "Certainly it is most striking of us," she
mused at last more to the lettuce than to the Young Doctor.
"But that poor womans over there?" she rallied transiently.
"Everywhere one goes it is the same. 'Old&mdash;old maid' is it
that you call her? So sad! So neglected! So 'romanticks' is
it <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>that you say? Everybodys she sees she thinks it is young
lovers! But personally," said the girl, "I am still very
hungry. Let us take what dessert is proffered." </p>

<p>"Oh, of course," acquiesced the Young Doctor. "If I've got to
be&mdash;if we've got to be&mdash;stared at, I mean, it would certainly
be quite as comfortable to have something to do." </p>

<p>"Perfectly," smiled the girl. "So as we wait for the ices and
the pies let us see what is survived of the toys." And before
the Young Doctor could dissuade her she had lifted her
awkwardly retied bundle to the level of the table, and was
earnestly studying out the relative damages of the green-
feathered parrot and the tiny tin railroad train. To confirm
apparently what was her own suspicion in the matter she
handed the railroad train to the Young Doctor for
investigation. </p>

<p>And because the Young Doctor was naturally and sincerely
inquisitive about anything that was broken he bent his dark
head to the task with a sudden real gasp of relief, and for
the next five minutes at least all possible awkwardness
between them seemed merged, then <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>and there, into the easy
give-and-take argument of a thoroughly familiar and
accustomed association. </p>

<p>Once again their small table became the cynosure of all eyes.
The dark Young Doctor alone was quite sufficiently striking
looking. And the girl in her Norse glow and blondness would
have been a marked figure anywhere. But together? And now? At
this very minute? So anxious, so painstaking, so brooding? If
the room had thought them shy "young lovers" a scant half
hour before, goodness knows what it thought them now! </p>

<p>The woman in the corner had most certainly reconstructed her
original impressions. On the way out from her own unsocial
supper she stopped impulsively just behind the Young Doctor's
chair to watch his rather surprising manipulation of the
fractured toy engine wheel. Her face was by no means
unpleasant, but almost exaggeratedly friendly in a plaintive,
deprecating sort of way. </p>

<p>From their focus on the Young Doctor's hands her pale eyes
lifted suddenly to the girl's glowing face, and she held out
a small paper bagful of pink-frosted cakes. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>

<p>"Take those home," she said, "instead of the poor broken
toys!" </p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, thank you!" laughed the girl. </p>

<p>"How&mdash;how old are your little ones?" asked the woman quite
irrelevantly. </p>

<p>"Eh?" jerked the Young Doctor. From his joggled hands the
little tin railroad train crashed down into his plate. </p>

<p>With her hands clapped playfully to her ears the girl looked
thoughtfully up at her accoster. </p>

<p>"Why, Lisa is four," she said quite simply. "And Jonathan is
six, and&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"Oh, have you got a 'Jonathan'?" kindled the woman. Her
sallow face was suddenly quite transfigured with light. "And
does he look like you?" she cried. "Or," sweeping the table
with another deprecating glance, "or does he take after his
father?" </p>

<p>"Take after his father?" repeated the girl in frank
perplexity. Her own sweeping glance of her companion's face
did not seem somehow to elucidate the mystery. "'Take?' 'Take
after his father?'" she flamed. "I do not know the idiot&mdash;the
idio&mdash;the&mdash;idiom!" she corrected herself triumphantly. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>

<p>A little bit perplexed herself, the amiable stranger began
suddenly to button up her coat. "Well, good night!" she
beamed. "Good night! Good night! I hope you may both live to
enjoy to the uttermost the full merits of your little
family!" </p>

<p>"Eh?" jumped the Young Doctor. White as a sheet he was
suddenly on his feet, and for the first time that evening a
real-looking smile had twisted itself across at least one
side of his thin-lipped mouth. </p>

<p>"Madam!" he bowed, "neither this young lady here nor I have
ever laid eyes on each other before! Nor is it remotely
probable indeed that in the normal course of events we should
ever lay eyes on each other again! But if you persist so," he
bowed, with a purely nervous glance at his watch, "but if you
persist so&mdash;in your&mdash;in your&mdash;" he floundered futilely. "We
shall doubtless be lying in the same grave by midnight!" </p>

<p>Without even a gasp then he snatched up the girl's purse, her
suitcase, her hat box, his own coat and hat, and bolted for
the cashier's desk. </p>

<p>Close behind him, clasping her scattered toys <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>as best she
might to her breast, followed the blonde Norse girl. </p>

<p>Even when they had finally reached the electric light post on
the farthest corner of the street, the color was only just
beginning to flush back into the Young Doctor's cheek bones. </p>

<p>"If you will now give me the address," he said tersely, "to
which I can forward the supper money, I will put you on a
street car." </p>

<p>"Oh, the address of course is of perfect simplicity,"
conceded the girl. "But I do not care for you to put me on a
street car, thank you!" </p>

<p>"Why, certainly I shall put you on a street car!" insisted
the Young Doctor. He was really quite sharp about it. "Almost
every thing goes by here&mdash;if you only wait long enough," he
shifted a bit uneasily, as he set down both box and suitcase
with a most decided thump. </p>

<p>Silently then for what seemed to him an interminable time
they stood there on the icy, wind-swept curbstone staring out
into the passing green, red, yellow, lights. </p>

<p>"Pretty, is it not!" commented the girl at last. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>

<p>"'Pretty?'" shivered the Young Doctor. "Why, yes, of course,
suppose so. But which car?" he laughed impatiently. "For
Heaven's sake, don't you know where you want to go?" </p>

<p>"Of course I know where I want to go!" flared the girl. With
a little light touch on his sleeve she pointed off to another
electric light post on a side street. "There!" she said.
"That little pleasant fifth house from the end! That is where
I am at boarding!" </p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you say so!" flushed the Young Doctor. Very
vehemently once more he snatched up her suitcase and her hat
box. </p>

<p>With a shrug of her fine athletic shoulders the girl laughed
right out loud into his frowning eyes. </p>

<p>"When a man is of such a positiveness as you are," she
confided impishly, "it is a privilege to reduce his national
characteristics. Ever for one single instant do you ask me,
'Have you finish your food?' or, 'Do you want to be put on a
car?' But always at your first wish you hurry out and scoot,
crying, 'I put you on a car! I put you on a car!'" With a
little sniff of scorn she turned on her <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>heel and started off
at a fine stride toward the house to which she had just
pointed. </p>

<p>It was the Young Doctor now who followed precipitously after. </p>

<p>The street was certainly a quaint, old-fashioned one, and the
boarding house in question by no means lacking in a fine
though dingy sort of dignity. </p>

<p>But the doorbell that the girl rang and rang brought no
reassuring answer. Fumbling anxiously in her purse for a
moment, she threw out her hands with a little gesture of
dismay. </p>

<p>"It is that I must also have mislaid my key," she frowned.
Then like a flash of pale sunshine her smile seemed to drive
every possible shadow from her mind. "Oh, well," she cried.
"It is after all only a scarce seven o'clock. Some one in not
many minutes will surely come. And meanwhile," she glowed.
"Of such a fine night! I will just sit down here very happy
and take the air!" </p>

<p>"Take the air?" gasped the Young Doctor. Quite unconsciously
as he spoke he reached up and drew his fur collar a little
bit closer about his neck. </p>

<p>But already the girl had dropped casually <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>down on the top
step and opened the throat of her own dark-fur red coat as
one who was fairly thirsting for air. </p>

<p>"Good night!" she said briskly. </p>

<p>"Good-by!" said the Young Doctor. Before he had even reached
the lower step he was congratulating himself that the
incident was now safely ended,&mdash;"comfortably ended," he
meant, instead of awkwardly, as it might so easily have been.
"Foreigners were often so irrational," he considered. Even as
he considered, he turned in spite of himself to investigate
the sudden unmistakable rustle of a paper bag. His suspicion
was frankly confirmed. </p>

<p>"See!" brandished the girl triumphantly. "The little pink
cake of the foolish woman!" With an unmistakable chuckle of
joy her white teeth met through the treasure. </p>

<p>In the flash of a second, the perfectly idiotic impulse of a
joke, the Young Doctor lifted a warning finger at her. </p>

<p>"You realize of course that you are eating a&mdash;a
misapprehension?" he admonished her with really terrifying
severity. </p>

<p>"A misapprehension?" jumped the girl. Very painstakingly then
and there she began to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span> explore the remaining piece of cake in
her hand, tugging at its sponginess, peering under its
frostedness. Then suddenly with a little quick gasp of relief
she popped the sweet morsel into her mouth and smacked her
lips upon it "Oh, no," she beamed. "It tastes perfectly all
right to me!" </p>

<p>Like a word slipping hopelessly down a poem toward whatever
chosen rhyme its Poet has already in mind, the Young Doctor
suddenly found himself bumping rather perilously close to the
one big wild hoot of laughter that had evidently been lurking
for him in the situation even from the very first. In a
really desperate effort to fend himself as long as possible
from such an undignified disaster he hastened in all
sincerity to rewrap himself in his stiffest professional
manner. </p>

<p>"Well, what about this 'Lisa' and 'Jonathan' business?" he
questioned with unmistakable reproach. </p>

<p>"Oh, shucks!" shrugged the girl. "This tiresome Lisa and
Jonathan, their whole parents are bakers! But as for me," she
lowered her voice, and thrust out her hands with a soft,
appealing gesture. "But as for me, until <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>to-night, for four
whole weeks I cry such salt into my food I cannot eat!
Homesickness, yes!" she nodded with a quick little catch of
her breath. "In all the world no one to speak with except one
fat lady and one thin lady and Lisa and Jonathan and Peter,
and&mdash;" In an extra impulse of confidence not unmixed
evidently with a certain flare of pride she slid forward a
little on the step. "I am Montessori!" she said. </p>

<p>"What?" snapped the Young Doctor. "Why, what nonsense!" he
said. "Why, what are you talking about? 'Montessori' is a&mdash;a
system! And she's an Italian, too, I mean." </p>

<p>"Yes, truly so," conceded the girl. "And in time if the
homeache can be assuaged I shall then learn the system&mdash;and
remain yet a Norwegian." </p>

<p>"Oh, you mean you are a Montessori student?" brightened the
Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Even so," said the girl. "I cannot wait to learn everything.
From here, after I have duly studied little Lisa, little
Peter, and all the others, whose minds most happily are of a
perfect brightness, I must then go on to the sadder <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>schools,
and to that most wonderful place in your Massachusetts where
such first brain work of all was made on the little children.
It is that in Norway," she winced, "I have a little brother.
Our father makes much money," she added with apparent
irrelevance. "And spends much and gives much. And once he
married him a new wife, and there are many new children. And
one of them, this little little brother, so gold, so blue, so
pinky, all day long he sits and&mdash;isn't," she finished
perfectly simply. </p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, that's too bad," said the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Yes, very bad," mused the girl. "But some of these ideas
here are of a great cleverness. I do not of course get any of
it right yet," she acknowledged. "But some of it is quite
sporting like a game. With these toys, now," she pointed,
"and all glad things like industries, and the live cat, and
the dog, and grasses and the flowers, you leave the little
child quite loose, it seems, only watching him, watching him
very close, one day, two days, a hundred if it seems best.
And wherever he shall in finality&mdash;in finality&mdash;'gravitate,'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>is it that you say? to the sweet flowers, or the wood blocks,
or the gay, smoothen cat, <i>there</i> it is that the one big
chance of his salvation will most surely be found. But the
engine, or the blocks or the smoothen cat must not be forced
on him, it is so you understand? Of such there would make no
message to his development. But out of <i>everything</i>, it is,
that he himself must gravitate to it!" </p>

<p>In the tense sweet earnestness of her up turned face, the
eager, unconscious nearness of her occasional gesture, the
far remoteness of her subject, the sting of the winter night,
the glare of electric light over all, it dawned on the Young
Doctor a bit startlingly that he was frowning down into the
eyes of a particularly beautiful woman, and for some quite
unreasonable reason his cheeks began suddenly to burn like
fire. It was as though having all his life long for one
conscientious reason or another denied himself "wine when it
was red," he found himself now, most humiliatingly, with <i>ice</i>
itself going to his head. And just because he was so
thoroughly unaccustomed to having anything go to his head, it
went quite <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>uproariously in fact, changing for that one moment
his whole facial expression. And the instant his facial
expression was changed of course he looked like a different
man. And the instant he looked like a different man of course
he began to act like a different man. </p>

<p>"And does this wonderful theory of yours apply only to poor
little children?" he asked with slightly narrowing eyes. "Or
am I to infer?" he laughed. "Or am I to infer that after a
whole year of flaunting city, a whole year of barren
indifference to it, my amazing gravitation to you this
evening is positive Montessori proof that with you and you
only rests my life's best salvation?" </p>

<p>Then without the slightest intent of doing it, without even
the slightest warning to himself that he was going to do it,
he swooped down suddenly and kissed her on her lips. </p>

<p>With a little gasp of dismay the girl stumbled to her feet.
There was nothing blonde now about her. Towering up on the
step just above him she was like a young storm-cloud all
flame and shadow! </p>

<p>"Oh, what have I done that you should act thus?" she
demanded. With the tears streaming <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>down her face she lashed
him with furious accusations. "You are one of these devils!"
she cried. "You are a wild persons! Was it my fault?" she
demanded, "that my bundles burst from the car? Was it my
fault," she demanded, "that restaurants cannot block foolish
women from their food? Was it my fault that I paid for your
stupid supper?" </p>

<p>Neither defending himself nor seeking relief in flight, but
with a face fully if not indeed more shocked than hers the
Young Doctor sank down on the step at her feet, and with his
head in his hands sat rocking himself to and fro. </p>

<p>"No, it isn't your fault!" he assured her and reassured her.
"Nor is it exactly my fault!" he insisted. "But the fault of
that damned piano!" </p>

<p>"The fault of that damned what?" quoted the girl a bit
stridently. </p>

<p>But the face that lifted to hers was frankly the face of a
stricken man. Only a chill added to repentance could have
altered so any human countenance. </p>

<p>"On the honor of a man freezing to death!" he attested.
"There is no blame to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>be attached to anything in the world&mdash;
except to a grand piano." </p>

<p>"What is it that you mean?" puzzled the girl. "I am more
furious with you than devils. But I must hear everything." </p>

<p>"I mean," sneezed the poor Young Doctor, "that I am looking
for a kind home for a grand piano!" Even to himself his words
sounded far away and altogether the words of a stranger. It
was indeed as though he had been thrust quite unrehearsed
into the leading part of a roaring farce which was already
halfway through its evening performance. A fearful spirit of
bravado seemed really his one chance of making any possible
"get-away" with the whole mad situation. But even an irate
audience could not have misjudged for a moment the acute
distress and anxiety behind the bravado. </p>

<p>"It is just this way," he began all over again. "A perfectly
dreadful woman drove me out of my office to-night&mdash;with a
grand piano!" From the stony expression, however, in the
girl's face this did not seem to be just the cue that she was
looking for. In the wisest impulse of his life he decided
suddenly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>to throw himself upon her sense of mercy rather than
upon her sense of humor. "Truly it is this way!" He jumped up
and implored her to believe him. "I am as new as you almost,
in this big city. Equally with you perhaps I suffer what you
call homeacheness! It is very hard to get a good start in a
strange place. Lots of charity chances and all that. But very
little money. I had a real patient once, though!" he bragged
ironically. "A very rich woman, awfully nice and all that.
But I hate her. Every chance that she gets she torments me.
She has a sort of theory, I think, that tormenting is very
stimulating to the nervous system. It certainly is. We fight
like young cats and dogs! And yet as I say she is awfully
nice. And when she went away she paid me not only justly but
mighty generously for my brief services. It cancelled almost
a year's debts. But she was horridly mad because I wouldn't
go with her,&mdash;as a kind of a trained, tame attendant you
know. But I told her I couldn't leave my office. So she sent
me a grand piano, the wretch!" he finished with flaming
anger. </p>

<p>To the step just below him the girl tripped <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>down and turning
about stood peering up into his face with a rather
disconcerting intensity. </p>

<p>"Here am I," she gasped, "who suffer and languish for a
'grand piano' as you call it. And you?" As though in real
pain she began to wring her slim hands together. "And you? A
lady gives you a grand piano and you curse her as a
wretchedness!" </p>

<p>"Yes, I know," deprecated the Young Doctor. "But you see
there isn't room in my office for both the piano and myself!
My office is too small, you see. And with the piano filling
up the whole center of the room? Why, it's absurd!" he
quickened. "It's rotten! Patients who come don't know whether
they've come for a music lesson or to be lanced! And
besides," he added as his most culminative grievance, "I
don't know one note from another! And the woman knew that I
didn't! And worse than anything there are hordes of the most
indecent little cupids appliqu&#233;d or something all over the
front of the thing!" </p>

<p>"Surely, something could be done," suggested the girl with a
vague sort of farawayness in her blue eyes. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>

<p>"Yes, that's just it!" remarked the Young Doctor, flushing.
"I've already done it!" </p>

<p>Abjectly with his bared head bowed before her he stood as one
awaiting just sentence. </p>

<p>"Of a personally," said the girl with her own cheeks spotting
bright red. "Of a personally&mdash;I do not quite see the
connection." </p>

<p>"Why the connection is perfectly clear!" insisted the Young
Doctor. "She sent me the piano on purpose to crowd me out of
my office! She wanted to crowd me out of my own office! She
dared to affirm even that I needed to be crowded out of my
own office! She tried to make me mad! She wanted to make me
mad! She had the cheek to suggest, I mean, that nothing
really interesting ever would happen to me until I once did
get good and mad!" As though temporarily exhausted by his
tirade he sagged back for a moment against the railing of the
steps. His face did look a bit white and his teeth were
almost chattering. "Well, I certainly did get good and mad
this afternoon," he affirmed with a wry sort of apology. "And
because I was so blooming mad I dashed out for a tremendous
walk. And because I took such a tremendous walk I developed
an <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span> appetite like forty tigers. And because I developed an
appetite like forty tigers I rushed for the first restaurant
I could find. And because I rushed for the first restaurant I
could find I happened to see you at the exact moment when&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"Oh, stop, stop, stop!" laughed the girl with her hands
clapped suddenly over her ears. "It is all too much like the&mdash;
like 'The House that the Jack-Man built!'" </p>

<p>"Well, at least," grinned the Young Doctor, "it seems to be
'The Adventure that the Grand Piano Threatened.'" </p>

<p>"The&mdash;the Adventure?" puzzled the girl. </p>

<p>"Why, yes," insisted the Young Doctor. "That's what this Mrs.
Tome Gallien prophesied you know, that the piano would bring
me an adventure! So you, very evidently, are the&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"What? I?" stammered the girl. A flush of real pleasure
glowed suddenly in her face and faded again as quickly as it
had come. "Oh, no!" she said with some hauteur, "You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"Oh, truly!" begged the Young Doctor. "I'm most awfully sorry
for what I did! I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>can't think what possessed me! I must have
gone quite mad for the moment! Why, really," he flushed, "I
don't know whether you'll believe me or not&mdash;and maybe it's
something anyway to be more ashamed of than to brag about,&mdash;
but truly now," he floundered, "I haven't kissed a girl
before since&mdash;since I was very little!" With a sudden quick
jerk of sheer awkwardness he snatched a card from his pocket
and handed it to her. "There! There's my address!" he cried.
"And to-morrow if you'll only send me the word I'll jump off
the bridge or throw myself under a truck, or make any other
sort of reparation whatever that happens to occur to you. But
to-night," he grinned, "I've simply got to get warm!" And
started down the steps. </p>

<p>But before he had quite reached the sidewalk the girl had
overtaken him and placed a detaining hand on his coat sleeve. </p>

<p>"How old is she?" questioned the girl. </p>

<p>"Who?" said the Young Doctor. "Oh, the woman? She's old
enough to be your mother." </p>

<p>"I'm twenty-one," conceded the girl. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span> </p>

<p>"Well, she's fifty," affirmed the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>Across the girl's translucent face a dozen conflicting
emotions seemed surging suddenly. "So?" she laughed. "So?"
she repeated experimentally, "If only you had not been so&mdash;so
<i>bad</i>," she sighed. "Well, about that piano," she ventured
with a certain unwonted shyness. "In a world of so much
racket is it not a pity that any harmonies should lie dumb?
Is it&mdash;is it a good piano?" she asked quite abruptly. </p>

<p>"Why, for heaven's sake, how do I know?" demanded the Young
Doctor. "It may be a&mdash;a Stradivarius!" he floundered wildly.
"But it looks to me like the&mdash;like the devil!" </p>

<p>"If I could only see it," whispered the girl, "I could tell
in a minute of course." </p>

<p>"If you could only see it?" scoffed the Young Doctor. Then,
"Well&mdash;well&mdash;why not?" he acknowledged a trifle tardily, but
with indisputable common sense. </p>

<p>"I have an aunt here," mused the girl, "who has a rheumatism
in her elbow, I think it is. On Friday afternoon next&mdash;if the
rheumatism perhaps should be sufficiently <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>bad?" Flushed with
the anticipatory ardor of a musician she lifted her eyes to
his. </p>

<p>"Why, capital!" acquiesced the Young Doctor. For the instant
the whole suggestion struck him as being extraordinarily apt.
"Well, good-by then," he laughed, "until Friday afternoon!"
And vanished into the night. </p>

<p>He was still a long, cold distance from home. But by the time
he had finally reached there his pulses were ringing with
fire rather than with frost. And as soon as he had started a
bright roaring flame in his stove, and concocted for himself
a most luscious and steamsome drink, and driven his frosted
toes into the farthest corners of some moth-eaten old fur
slippers, he sat right down in a great spirit of diablerie to
tell Mrs. Tome Gallien just what he thought of her. </p>

<p>"I hope you're  satisfied!" he began quite abruptly in a firm
and emphatic black hand writing. "Driven out into the winter
streets by your most charming gift, I have in four short
hours walked eleven miles; supped in a conspicuous restaurant
with a perfectly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>strange girl and at her expense; been
branded publicly for all time, first as the girl's beau and
later as her husband and the father of certain imaginary
children; and have also in due time, still included in the
original four hours, you understand, kissed said girl 'Good-
night' on her own doorstep in the full glare of a city
electric light,&mdash;and am now at ten-thirty P. M. of the
aforesaid Monday evening waiting patiently in my room until
Friday afternoon next when, heavily chaperoned by some kind
of a relative with rheumatism, the said Adventure will appear
to investigate the piano&mdash;and myself. </p>

<p>"Once again, in the language of my opening sentence, and with
all due respects, I repeat, 'I hope you're satisfied'!" </p>

<p>Then quite contented both in fancy and in fact he settled
down to kill time and cure patients until Friday. </p>

<p>But the intervening days it seemed were not to be bereft
entirely of sensations either confusing or bizarre. </p>

<p>On Wednesday night he heard from Mrs. Tome Gallien. And by
telegram. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>

<p>"Bungler!" wired Mrs. Tome Gallien. "What in
creation have you done? The adventure intended for you does
not arrive till Saturday, office, four o'clock." </p>

<p>The message happened to be delivered in writing this time, a
flaunting yellow page, and, still clutching it tight by one
twittering corner, the Young Doctor dropped down into the
first chair he could reach, and with his chin dropped low
like an old man's on his breast sat staring for an
interminable time into his glowing fire. </p>

<p>Then quite suddenly at nine o'clock, with the funny new smile
that he seemed to have acquired somewhere recently, he walked
over to his telephone, fumbled a minute with the directory,
experimented at least two minutes with Central's temper,
located Miss Solvei Kjelland, and addressed her in his most
formal manner. </p>

<p>"Miss Solvei Kjelland?" he questioned. </p>

<p>"S-o," said the familiar voice at the other end of the wire. </p>

<p>"This is Doctor Kendrue," he growled. "Dr. Sam Kendrue." <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span> </p>

<p>"So?" conceded the voice without a vestige of affright. </p>

<p>"It seems, Miss Kjelland," he stammered, "that there has been
some sort of a&mdash;of a&mdash;well, misunderstanding about Friday
afternoon. It is all a mistake, it seems, about your being
The Adventure! Mrs. Gallien indeed has just telegraphed to
that effect. The 'Real Adventure,' it appears, is not due at
my office until four o'clock on Saturday!" </p>

<p>"S-o?" conceded Miss Solvei Kjelland. If she seemed to be
swallowing rather extra hard once or twice the sound was not
sharply discernible certainly from the little fluttering
swallow of the telephone instrument. "So?" she repeated
blithely. "Well, that is all right. The piano keeps! And the
Saturday afternoon is just as good to me as the Friday! And I
am all as curious with joy as you to see what it is, this
Adventure that is more nice than me! Good night!" </p>

<p>"Good&mdash;night!" admitted the Young Doctor. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>



<h3>II </h3>

<p>THAT the Young Doctor bought himself a new blue serge suit
for Saturday was no indication whatsoever that he looked
forward to that day with any pleasurable anticipation. Lots
of people "doll-up" for disaster who couldn't even be hired
to brush their hair for joy. </p>

<p>Quite frankly if anybody had asked him about it, the Young
Doctor would have rated Mrs. Tome Gallien as a disaster. </p>

<p>If pressed further for justification of such a rating he
would have argued that any rich woman who couldn't sleep was
a disaster! </p>

<p>"Oh, it's all well enough for poor people," he would have
admitted, "to put in the long night watches mulling over the
weird things that they'd like to do. But when a person is
actually able to leap up at the first gay crack of dawn and
finance the weirdest fancy of his night! </p>

<p>"Oh, of course," he was honest enough to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>acknowledge. "Poor
Mrs. Tome Gallien would never again while life lasted be able
to 'leap up' at <i>any</i> hour of the day or night! And she
doubtless in her fifty eccentric years <i>had</i> given
extravagantly to no end of people who had proved themselves
the stingiest sort of receivers! And her sense of humor even
in her remotest, happiest youth must have been of course
essentially caustic! </p>

<p>"But how any woman could reach a point so sick, so
vindictive, so caustic, so rich, that still unable to strip
herself of her lifelong passion for giving she should evolve
the perfectly diabolic idea of giving people only the things
that they didn't want&mdash;only the things, indeed, that she was
absolutely positive they didn't want? Such as pianos! Grand
pianos! Huge rosewood chunks of intricate mechanism and
ornate decoration and Heaven knows what expense&mdash;crammed down
into the meager crowded office of some poor struggling young
doctor who didn't know a note from a gnat! Himself of course
being the young doctor! </p>

<p>"Thought it was funny, did she? Thought it would really drive
him outdoors for sheer <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span> rage into some sort of an enlivening
adventure? That was her theory, was it? Well it <i>was</i> funny.
And it <i>had</i> driven him out to meet a rather particularly
enlivening sort of adventure! Which adventure in the person
of a Miss Solvei Kjelland was now due at his office by her
own insistent appointment, on Saturday afternoon at four
o'clock. But this Miss Solvei Kjelland, it seems, was not the
Adventure which Mrs. Tome Gallien had already arranged for
him for Saturday afternoon, same hour, same place?" </p>

<p>Into his muddled mind flashed transiently a half-forgotten
line of a novel to the effect: "Heaven help the day when the
mate you made for yourself and the mate God made for you
happen to meet!" </p>

<p>"Well, if it really came to a show-down between his Adventure
and Mrs. Tome Gallien's?" </p>

<p>Quite unexpectedly his mouth began suddenly to twitch at one
corner. Speaking of "caustic humor" it was barely possible
that the Young Doctor had just a tiny bit of caustic humor
himself. When a man smiles suddenly on one side of his mouth
it is proof at least <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>that he sees the joke. Nobody ought to
be expected to smile on both sides till he feels the joke as
well as sees it. </p>

<p>Certainly the poor Young Doctor was not feeling very much of
anything at just this time except a sense of impending doom. </p>

<p>But in this sense of impending doom flickered the one ray of
light that at least he knew what his own Adventure was: she
was young, lithe, blonde, why as tall as himself, almost! A
trifle unconventional, perhaps? Yes, even a good bit amazing!
But thoroughly wholesome! And human? Yes that was just it, so
deliciously and indisputably human! </p>

<p>But Mrs. Tome Gallien's Adventure? A woman like Mrs. Tome
Gallien wouldn't stop at anything! It might be a pair of
llamas from Peru! Or a greasy witchy-gypsy to tell his
fortune! Or a homeless little jet-black pickaninny with a
banjo and&mdash;consumption! Or&mdash;or an invitation even to lecture
on physiology at a girls school! But whatever it proved to be
he might just as well realize now that it would be something
that he hated. Mrs. Tome Gallien in her present mood would
certainly never seek to lull him with a "glad" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>as long as she
saw any possible chance to rouse him with a "mad"! </p>

<p>"Well, he wouldn't get mad yet, anyway!" he promised himself
with unwonted whimsicality. "And if it <i>was</i> llamas&mdash;which
perhaps on the whole would be his preference out of the
various possibilities anticipated&mdash;they would at least,
judging from the woolly pictures in the geographies, be free
from any possible danger of barking their shins against the
sharper edges of the piano. Whereas a committee of any size
come to request a series of lectures on&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>Thus with one form or another of light mental exercise did he
try to keep his brain clear and his pulse normal for the
approaching Saturday. </p>

<p>But Saturday itself dawned neither clear nor normal. Rain,
snow, slush, wind, had changed the whole outdoor world into a
blizzard. </p>

<p>It was one of those days when anything might blow in. But how
in the world would it ever blow out again? With this threat
of eternity added to uncertainty the Young Doctor decided
quite impulsively to dust his desk, and investigate his ice-
chest. To his infinite <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>relief he found at least very little
food in the ice-chest. Whatever happened it could not
possibly prove a very long siege! A half pound of butter, a
box of rusks, a can of coffee, six or seven eggs, divided up
among any kind of a committee, or even between two llamas? At
the increasing excitability of his fancies he determined very
suddenly to sober himself with hard reading. </p>

<p>With this intent, as soon as he had finished his breakfast he
took down from his bookcase a very erudite treatise on "The
Bony Ankylosis of the Temporomandibular Joint" and proceeded
to devote himself to it. "Now here was something serious.
Thoroughly serious. Science! Heaven be praised for Science!" </p>

<p>By noon, indeed, he was so absorbed in "The Bony Ankylosis of
the Temporomandibular Joint" that he quite forgot about
luncheon. And at three o'clock he looked down with a glance
of surprise to see that the toes of his boots were dipping
into a tiny rivulet which seemed flowing to him from the
farther side of the room. By craning his neck around the
corner of the piano he noted with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>increasing astonishment
that the rivulet sprang essentially from the black ferule of
an umbrella, and that just beyond the dripping black ferule
of that umbrella was the dripping black ferule of another
umbrella, and beyond that, still an other! </p>

<p>Jumping joyously to his feet he made three apologies in one
to the group that loomed up before him. </p>

<p>"Why, I beg your pardon," he began to the wheezy old man who
sat nearest him. "Really I&mdash;I&mdash;had no idea," he explained
painstakingly to the small freckled boy just beyond. "With
all this wind and everything&mdash;and the way the rain rattles
against the window," he stammered to the crape-swathed woman
in the far corner. None of these was presumably Mrs. Tome
Gallien's Adventure, but it was surely adventure enough of
itself on the old oak settle, where almost no one ever sat
even on pleasant days, to behold three patients sitting
crowded&mdash;and in a blizzard! "I was so absorbed in my book!"
he boasted with sudden nonchalance. </p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, sir," wheezed the Old Man. "I was just
waitin' for a car. And it looked drier in here than where I
was standin' outdoors." <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<div class="center"><img src="images/3_by_craning_his_neck.jpg" alt="By craning his neck"/>
<div class="caption">By craning his neck around the corner of the piano, he noted
with increasing astonishment that the rivulet sprang from the black ferule of an umbrella</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>



<p>And "Say, Mister, do you pull teeth?" questioned the small
freckled boy. </p>

<p>But the Crape-Swathed Lady was a real patient. Though
goodness knows the Young Doctor would gladly have drawn
either the old man or the small boy in her place. All his
life long he had particularly disapproved of "mourning." It
was false, spiritually, he thought. It was bad,
psychologically. Everybody knew of course that it was unwise
hygienically. But worst of anything perhaps the woman before
him now made him think of a damp black cat. </p>

<p>It was perfectly evident, however, that the lady herself
cherished no such unpleasant self-consciousness. </p>

<p>With perfect complacency at his request she came forward to
the light, or at least to such light as the storm-lashed
window allowed and, still swathed as blackly from view as any
harem lady, stated her case. </p>

<p>"I have such a pain&mdash;here," she pointed with black-gloved
hand toward her black-veiled face. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>

<p>Did she also take him for a tooth puller? mused the Young
Doctor. With all haste he sought to settle the matter at
once. "If you will kindly remove your&mdash;er&mdash;bonnet&mdash;is it that
you call it?" he asked. </p>

<p>Compliantly the unpleasant black-gloved hands busied
themselves for a moment with pin or knot until emerging
slowly from its dank black draperies there lifted at last to
the Young Doctor's gasping stare the most exquisitely-
featured, dreamy-eyed young brunette face that he had ever
seen outside a Salon catalogue. </p>

<p>"Here! Just here is the pain!" pointed the black-gloved
finger to a spot right in front of the most absurd little
ear. </p>

<p>"Bony Ankylosis of the Temporomandibular Joint!" gasped the
Young Doctor just like a swear. Even as scientifically as he
touched the pain-spot he felt his own wrist wobble most
unscientifically with the contact. It was no wonder perhaps
that the dark eyes before him dilated with a vague sort of
alarm. </p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is it as bad as that?" faltered his patient. </p>

<p>"Why, it isn't that at all!" hastened the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>Young Doctor with a
sudden resumption of sagacity. "It's probably just a sort of
rheumatism. What made me cry out so was just a mere funny
coincidence. This particular kind of pain being a subject
that I&mdash;that I&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;have been giving rather
special attention to lately." </p>

<p>"Oh, then I trust that I have come to just the right person,"
smiled the dark eyes with a kindling surface-sweetness that
seemed nevertheless quite frankly bereft of any special inner
enthusiasm. </p>

<p>"We will certainly hope so!" flushed the Young Doctor. "How
about this pain&mdash;?" he began quite abruptly. </p>

<p>"It hurts me when I eat," said the girl. Her voice was very
low and soft and drawling. "And when I drink. And when I
talk," she confided. "But especially when I sing." </p>

<p>"Oh, you sing?" questioned the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Yes!" said the girl. For the first time her classic,
immobile little face was quick with a very modern emotion. </p>

<p>"Personally," confessed the Young Doctor, "I should like very
much to try a little <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>experiment on you if you don't mind. It
will help me, even if it hurts you." </p>

<p>"As you wish," acquiesced the girl with the same
imperturbable little smile. </p>

<p>From his precipitous retreat into the other room he returned
after due delay with a plate of rusks and a steaming hot cup
of coffee. </p>

<p>"It's such a horrid day," he said. "And you look so wet and
cold, perhaps a taste of coffee wouldn't come in altogether
amiss. But it's these rusks that I'm really interested in. I
want you to bite down hard on them. And then presently
perhaps I will ask you to sing so that I may watch the&mdash;Oh,
by the way," he interrupted himself irrelevantly. "I
neglected, I think, to ask your name." </p>

<p>"My name," said the girl, "is Kendrue." </p>

<p>"What?" questioned the Young Doctor. "Why that is my name,"
he smiled. </p>

<p>"Yes, I know," murmured the girl. "Coincidences of that sort
are certainly very strange. It was one of the first things my
aunt spoke of when I asked her advice about what physician to
go to. I am a comparative stranger in the city," she added a
bit shiveringly. "But didn't my aunt tell you I was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>coming?"
she quickened suddenly. "Didn't my aunt, Mrs. Tome Gallien,
write you&mdash;or something&mdash;that I was coming?" </p>

<p>"Mrs. Tome Gallien?" jumped the Young Doctor. Chaotically
through his senses quickened a dozen new angers, a dozen new
resentments. A girl? So this was Mrs. Tome Gallien's
threatened "Adventure," was it? Of all the spiteful
possibilities in the world, now wasn't this just like the
amiable lady in question to foist another girl into a
situation quite sufficiently embarrassed with "girl" as it
was! "Is&mdash;is Mrs. Tome Gallien your&mdash;aunt?" he demanded with
such sudden stentorious sternness that even the most bona
fide blood-relation would hardly have acquiesced without
pausing an instant to reconsider the matter. </p>

<p>"Well, not of course, not exactly a real aunt," admitted the
girl. "But I have always called her my aunt. We have always
been very intimate. Or rather perhaps I should say she had
always been very, very kind to me. And now, since my father&mdash;"
With the unmistakable air of one who strives suddenly to
suppress an almost overwhelming emotion she pointed
irrelevantly to the piano and waved <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>off the plate of rusks
and the cup of coffee which the Young Doctor still stood
proffering. "You must excuse me if I&mdash;if I&mdash;seem distrait,"
she stammered. "But in addition to the very real annoyance
that this little pain in my jaw is giving me I am&mdash;I am so
bewildered about that piano! Where did you get it?" she asked
quite bluntly. </p>

<p>"Why it came from Such-and-Such warerooms I believe,"
admitted the Young Doctor with as much frankness as he could
summon at the moment. </p>

<p>With a little soft sigh the girl reached out and touched the
dark, gleaming woodwork. </p>

<p>"I thought so," she whispered. "And&mdash;oh, how you must love
it! It is certainly the most beautiful instrument that I ever
saw in my life! The most melodious, I mean! The most nearly
perfect sounding-board! An utter miracle of tone and
flexibility as an accompanist to the human voice!" </p>

<p>"U&mdash;m&mdash;mmmm," said the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"For two months," persisted the girl, "I have been haunting
the warerooms you speak of! For two months I have been moving <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
heaven and earth in an effort to possess it! But my means
being temporarily tied up," she shivered again ever so
slightly, "I was not able immediately to&mdash;" With that odd,
inert little smile she reached out for the plate of rusks and
took one as the Young Doctor had requested. "Yes, here is the
pain," she explained conscientiously. "But only last week,"
she winced, "on my birthday it was! I had every reason in the
world to believe that Mrs. Tome Gallien was going to give the
piano to me! She has given me so many wonderful things! But
she sent me instead the deed to a duck blind down somewhere
on the South Carolina coast,&mdash;shooting, you know? And
dreadful guns! And dogs! And all that! I, who wouldn't even
hurt a sparrow, or scare a kitten!" </p>

<p>With his hands clapped to his head the Young Doctor swung
around suddenly and started for the window. </p>

<p>"Was this a comic opera? A farce? A phantasy of not enough
work and too much worry? Was every mention of Mrs. Tome
Gallien's name to be a <i>scream?</i> As long as life lasted? As
long as&mdash;?" Startled by a tiny gasp he turned to find his
little visitor <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>convulsed with tears but still struggling
bravely to regain her self-possession. "Oh, please don't
think I'm always as&mdash;as weak as this," she pleaded through
her sobs. "But with pain and disappointment and everything
happening so all at once. And with my big loss so recent&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"How long ago did you lose your father?" asked the Young
Doctor, very gently. </p>

<p>"My father?" stammered the girl. White now as the death she
mourned she lifted her stricken face to his. "Why it wasn't
father I was talking about," she gasped. "It was my husband." </p>

<p>"Your husband?" cried the Young Doctor. Two minutes ago was
<i>this</i> the situation that he had cursed out as a farce, a
comic opera? This poor, stricken, exquisite, heartbroken
little widow, tagged out by Mrs. Tome Gallien as an
"Adventure" and foisted on his attention like some gay new
kind of a practical joke? It was outrageous! he fumed.
"Inexcusably brutal!" </p>

<p>"Colorado&mdash;is where it happened," he had to bend his head to
hear. "Almost a year and a half ago," strangled the poor
little voice, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>"and we hadn't been married a year. Lung
trouble it was, something dreadfully acute. Mrs. Tome Gallien
did everything. She's always done everything. It's something
about my father I think. Oh, ages and ages ago they were
lovers it seems. But&mdash;but she chose to make a worldier
marriage. And later, my father&mdash;why she bought my whole
trousseau for me!" suffered the sweet voice afresh. "Went to
Paris herself for it, I mean!" </p>

<p>Across the Young Doctor's memory a single chance sentence
came flashing back "The daughter of a man who once meant
something to me in my youth." So this was the girl? The
little "Stingy Receiver"? Among all Mrs. Tome Gallien's so-
called "stingy receivers" the one unquenchable pang in an
otherwise reasonably callous side? Precious undoubtedly,
poignant, eternally significant, yet always and forever the
flesh that was not of her flesh nor the spirit quite of her
spirit. Familiar eyes&mdash;perhaps? An alien mouth? A dimple that
had no right, possibly, haunting a lean, loved cheek line?
Fire, flame, ice, ashes? A torch to memory, a scorch <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>to hope!
But whose smile was it, anyway? That maddeningly casual and
inconsequent little "Thank You" smile searing its way
apparently with equal impartiality across chiffon or crape,&mdash;
a proffered chair, or eagerest promise of relief from pain?
Had Mrs. Tome Gallien's life, by chance, gone a-wreck on just
that smile? And why in Heaven's name, if people loved each
other, did they let anything wreck them? And back of that&mdash;
what did people want to love each other for anyway? What good
was it? All this old loving-and-parting-and-marrying-some-
one-else fretting its new path now all over again into
chiffon-and-crape! "Bony-Ankylosis-of-the-Temporomandibular-
Joint!" At the very taste of the phrase his mind jumped out
of its reverie and back to the one real question at hand. "If
you please, now!" he implored his visitor. "Just a little of
the coffee! Just a crunch or two of the rusk!" Urgently as he
spoke he began proffering first one and then the other. "And
this crying?" he persisted. "Does this also hurt you?" </p>

<p>From the doorway beyond him he sensed suddenly the low sound
of footsteps and looked <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>up into Solvei Kjelland's laughing
face. Blue as a larkspur in a summer hail-storm, crisp,
shimmery, sparkling with frost, even her blonde hair tucked
into a larkspur-blue storm hat, she stood there shaking a
reproachful finger at both the Young Doctor and his patient. </p>

<p>"Oh, Ho! For what a pity!" she laughed. "If you had but told
me that Mrs. Tome Gallien's adventure was to be a picnic then
I also could have brought the food!" </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<div class="center"><img src="images/4_excuse_me_miss_kjelland.jpg" alt="Excuse me, Miss Kjelland"/>
<div class="caption">"Excuse me, Miss Kjelland," he said; "but this is not a
picnic&mdash;it is a clinic" </div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>


<p>"Picnic?" frowned the Young Doctor. Before the plaintive
bewilderment in the dark eyes that lifted at just that
instant to his an unwonted severity crisped into his voice.
"Excuse me, Miss Kjelland," he said; "but this is not a
picnic&mdash;it is a clinic." </p>

<p>"So? Who is a clinic?" cried Solvei Kjelland perfectly
undaunted, and swished bluely forward to join them. "It is
not of course of a propriety, Doctor Kendrue," she laughed,
"that I should come thus without the sick aunt! But in a
storm so unwholesome for aunt is it not best that I buy some
good medicine?" In a shimmer of melting snowflakes she
perched herself on the arm of the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>first chair she could
reach, and extracting the familiar little purse from her big
blue pocket handed the Young Doctor a one-dollar bill.
"Medicine for the sick aunt!" she commandeered gaily. Then
with only the most casual glance at the piano she whirled
around to scrutinize the desolate little figure before her.
If she noticed the tears she certainly gave no sign of it. </p>

<p>"Ah! It is as I thought!" she triumphed. "Most surely in my
mind did I say that you would be a girl!" In one sweeping
blue-eyed glance she seemed to be appraising suddenly every
individual tone and feature of the dark, exquisite little
face that lifted so bewilderedly to hers. Then quite
unexpectedly a most twinkling smile flickered across her own
sharply contrasted blondeness and like a fine friendly child
she held out her hand in greeting. "Most certainly," she
conceded, "you are more cute than I! But also in some ways,"
she beamed, "I am of course more cute than you!" </p>

<p>While the Young Doctor waited for the skies to fall, he saw
instead, to his infinite amazement, that the little brunette
though still bewildered was returning the handshake with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>unquestionable cordiality. "Awfully well-bred women were like
that," he reasoned quickly. "No matter how totally
disorganized they might be by silly things like mice or toads
you simply couldn't faze them when it came to a purely social
emergency." And in a situation which had thus precipitously
reached a point so hopelessly non-professional there seemed
after all but one thing left for him to do. </p>

<p>"Miss Kjelland!" he essayed with a really terrifying
formality, "This is Mrs. Kendrue!" The instant the phrase had
left his lips his very ears were crimsoning with the one
possible implication which Miss Solvei Kjelland would draw
from such an announcement, and more panic-stricken than any
woman would have been with a mouse he turned and fled for his
medicine cabinet in the very farthest corner of the room. </p>

<p>"Your wife?" faltered Solvei Kjelland in frank astonishment.
"S&mdash;o?" she laughed. "And I have only just come! Mix me a
quarter's worth more of the good medicine, Mr. Doctor!" she
called back over her shoulder, and dropped down on the low
stool <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>at the other girl's feet. "Now about this piano!" she
began precipitously. </p>

<p>"I am not Doctor Kendrue's wife!" protested the little black
figure bewilderedly. "Why&mdash;why I thought you were his wife,"
she confided with increasing confusion. </p>

<p>From the direction of the medicine cabinet the sound of some
one choking was distinctly audible. Both girls rose
instinctively to meet&mdash;only the Young Doctor's perfectly
inscrutable face. </p>

<p>"Who now is eating a Miss&mdash;mis-apprehension?" beamed Solvei. </p>

<p>"Mrs. Kendrue is a patient of mine," affirmed the Young
Doctor with some coldness. </p>

<p>"O-h," conceded the Norse girl with equal coldness. "A
patient? That is most nice. But&mdash;" As though suddenly muddled
all over again by this latest biographical announcement she
threw out her hands with a frank gesture of despair. "If this
should be a patient," she implored, "who then is the 'Other
Adventure'?" </p>

<p>Behind the little black figure's back the Young Doctor lifted
a quick warning finger to his lips. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>

<p>"S-s-h!" he signaled beseechingly to her. </p>

<p>On Solvei Kjelland's forehead the incongruous frown deepened
from perplexity into something very like impatience. </p>

<p>"Well certainly," she attested. "You are of a great sobriety
in your office, but most wild on the doorstep. As for me,"
she confided, "it is of the piano and the piano only that I
care!" </p>

<p>"That's just it," said the Young Doctor, "it is of the piano
and the piano only that Mrs. Kendrue cares!" </p>

<p>With her finger-tips already touching the ivory keys the
Norse girl swung sharply around. </p>

<p>"What is that?" she demanded. </p>

<p>With a sudden impish conviction that Mrs. Tome Gallien, being
already responsible for so many awkward situations in the
world, might just as well now be responsible for everything,
the Young Doctor gathered breath for his latest announcement. </p>

<p>"Mrs. Kendrue," he smiled with studied calm, "is the niece,&mdash;
as it were, of the lady who gave me the piano." <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>

<p>"What," stammered both girls in a single breath. </p>

<p>But it was the little widow's turn this time to be the most
dumfounded. "What," she repeated with a vague new sort of
pain. "What? You mean that Mrs. Tome Gallien gave <i>you</i> the
piano&mdash;when&mdash;when she knew how I had been longing for it all
these months? Been haunting the warerooms day after day!" she
explained plaintively over her black shoulder to the other
girl. "Why&mdash;why do <i>you</i> love music so?" she demanded with
sudden vehement passion of the Young Doctor. "Are you a real
musician, I mean?" </p>

<p>"On the contrary," bowed the Young Doctor, "I am as tender-
hearted about pianos as you are about ducks. Nothing under
Heaven would induce me to lay my rough, desecrating hand upon
a piano." In an impulse of common humanity he turned to allay
the new bewilderment in Solvei Kjelland's face. "This
allusion about ducks," he explained, "concerns another little
idiosyncrasy of Mrs. Tome Gallien's." </p>

<p>"Yes!" quickened the little widow. "When she sent Doctor
Kendrue this wonderful piano <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>she sent me a&mdash;a dreadful duck
blind&mdash;way down somewhere in South Carolina!" </p>

<p>"What is that?" puzzled Solvei Kjelland. </p>

<p>"Why a place to shoot!" snapped the Young Doctor. "Wild
ducks, you know! 'Quack-Quack!' A&mdash;a sporting camp!" His
whole face was suddenly alight. </p>

<p>"O-h! And this little Mrs. Kendrue does not sport," reflected
Solvei. In another instant her own face was all alight too.
"Oh, of what a nonsense!" she laughed. "Of what a silliness!
It is of course a mistake, most funny, most conflictable! In
some way it is that the gifts should get mixed in the mails!" </p>

<p>"Oh, no!" wagged the Young Doctor's head. "Oh, no!" he
reiterated with some emphasis. "Careless as I assure you many
of the post-offices are there is very little likelihood of a
grand piano and a duck blind getting mixed in the mails." </p>

<p>"O-h," subsided the Norse girl, but only for an instant.
"What my idea should be," she resumed cheerfully, "and what
the idea of my aunt should be, is that if you would let us
take the piano&mdash;one month, two months, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>three, we would in
return give you some lessons in this music, either in the
piano or of the vocal." </p>

<p>"U-m-m," said the Young Doctor, "Yes&mdash;yes, of course that
would undoubtedly be very humanizing and all that, but with
so much unexpected competition, as it were, one must move
very,&mdash;er&mdash;slowly in the matter. Just what&mdash;just what would
be your idea, Mrs. Kendrue?" he turned and asked quite
abruptly. </p>

<p>"My idea?" flushed the little widow. "Why&mdash;why, of course I
didn't have any idea because I didn't even know that you
possessed the piano until just now. But if you are still
willing to part with it after&mdash;after the estate is settled,"
she hurried with evident emotion, "why, then&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I&mdash;"
Yearningly as she spoke she stepped forward to the piano and
fingered out one chord after another, soft, vibrant,
experimental, achingly minor, a timid, delicate nature's
whole unconscious appeal to life for help, love, tenderness. </p>

<p>"Dear me!" mused the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Oh! Do you play?" cried Solvei Kjelland ecstatically. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span> </p>

<p>"Oh, no," deprecated the little widow. "I just sing. Do <i>you</i>
sing?" she in turn demanded as though her very heart jumped
with the question. </p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Solvei Kjelland, "I just play." Yearningly she
in turn stepped forward and struck a single chord. But there
was nothing soft or minor about this one chord. Sharp, clear,
stirring as a clarion call it rang out through the dingy
room. </p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" thought the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>And as though flaming then and there with the musical fervor
so long suppressed the Norse girl swung impetuously round
upon her companion. "You do not play! And I do not sing! So
let us!" she cried excitedly and dropping down on the piano
stool seemed literally melting her fluent finger-tips into
ivory-key and melody. </p>

<p>Indefinitely for a brilliant, chaotic moment or two, chord
heaped upon chord and harmony upon harmony, and then suddenly
to the Young Doctor's musically untutored mind it seemed as
though the crashing waves of sound were literally parting on
either side to let a little tune come through. And such a
"pleasant <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>familiar tune" he rated it delightedly. He didn't
remember that Verdi wrote it. He didn't stop to consider that
it was from Trovatore. All he cared was that it was a tune,
and a tune that said things, and a tune that always said the
same things whether you heard it chopped through a hurdy-
gurdy on an asphalt pavement or roared stentoriously by a
band at the beach. "Home to our Mountains!" was what it said,
and oh, other things too, undoubtedly, but that was all that
really mattered, "Home to our Mountains!" </p>

<p>It was perfectly evident, though, that the little widow cared
who wrote it, and what it was from, and where it was going
to! With thrilling sweetness, astonishing technique, and most
amazing volume, her rich contralto voice rang suddenly
through the room. And in the precipitous jump of his heart
was it any wonder that the poor Young Doctor couldn't have
told for the life of him whether the mischief was all in one
girl's voice or another girl's finger-tips, or partly in the
voice and partly in the finger-tips&mdash;or&mdash;? "Home to our
Mountains," soared the lovely voice, then quivered suddenly,
like some wounded thing, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>and with her hands pressed tightly
to her cheek, the little singer sank weakly down in the first
chair she could reach. </p>

<p>"Why, what is it!" jumped the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>Through a haze of tears the dark eyes lifted to his. "Oh,
nothing special," faltered the little singer. "Just
everything!" </p>

<p>With an irrelevant crash of chords Solvei Kjelland swung
sharply round from the piano. </p>

<p>"Who is this Mrs. Tome Gallien, anyways?" she demanded
fiercely. "And where is her habit? And what good is she? To
hold back from people thus the things they want and stuff
them all choke-up with what they don't want,&mdash;it is a scandal
I say! It is a monstrosity!" With a quick, jerky sort of
defiance she rose to her feet and commenced straightening her
blue hat and tightening up her blue collar. "I am a failure
as One Adventure," she laughed. "And I also get nothing!
Neither the piano, nor the medicine for the sick aunt. Give
me the address of this woman," she demanded. "And I will
write to her in my leisure and tell her what my thoughts of
her should be!" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>

<p>"Do!" urged the Young Doctor. "Nothing would please her more!
When a woman has the ego that Mrs. Tome Gallien has there's
nothing in the world that tickles her vanity so as to hear
just what people think of her, be it good, bad, or
indifferent." With deliberate malice he tore a leaf from his
notebook, scribbled the desired address on it and handed it
to the Norse girl. "If it doesn't do anything else," he
commended her with mock gravity, "it may at least draw the
fire!" </p>

<p>"'Draw the fire'?" repeated the Norse girl a bit perplexedly.
Then as though to shrug all perplexity aside she turned
suddenly to the young widow. "As for you&mdash;" she beamed. "You
are a cunning little thing! And I loves you!" With
unmistakable tenderness she stooped and kissed the astonished
little singer on the forehead. "And I hope you will soon be
of a perfect wellness," she coaxed. "And sing the perfectly
whole songs to whatever piano it is that you should love the
best! As for me?" she called briskly to the Young Doctor. "It
is that you understand I am perfectly resigned?" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>

<p>"Resigned to what?" frowned the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Oh, this language!" laughed Solvei. "Do you know your own
words? To? Of? It is the <i>from</i> that I would say! Complete
<i>from</i> the Adventure I am resigned!" </p>

<p>"S-s-h! S-sh!" warned the Young Doctor's frowning face once more.
Almost anxiously he accompanied her to the door. "S-sh&mdash;s-s-h!"
he implored her. "The poor little girl must never know of Mrs.
Tome Gallien's audacity in sending her here as an 'Adventure.'
With all the sorrow she's in just now, and the pain&mdash;" </p>

<p>"Yes, quite so," acquiesced Solvei Kjelland with perfect
docility. Then all of a blue-blonde flutter in the open
doorway she turned to call back her blithe "Good-by." </p>

<p>"Good-by, Doctor and Mrs. Kendrue!" she called. "What? <i>No?</i>"
she flushed at the very evident consternation in both
uplifted faces. "Good-by then, Mrs. and Doctor Kendrue!" she
revised her adieus hastily. "<i>What</i>? <i>N-o</i>?" she flared with
her first real sign of impatience. "Well then, good-by, Mrs.
and <i>not</i> Doctor Kendrue!" she finished <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>triumphantly, and
vanished into the snowstorm. Turning back to his somber
office and his sad little patient it seemed suddenly to the
Young Doctor as though the first blue bird had fled, leaving
only a single black iris bud to presage spring for the
garden. "Blue birds were darlings!" quickened the Young
Doctor. "And yet?" Poignantly to his memory revived a misty
May time years and years ago when he had sat cross-legged in
the grass a whole day through&mdash;to watch the unfolding miracle
of a black iris bud! </p>

<p>In consideration of the particular speed and energy which
Solvei Kjelland applied that afternoon to her homeward plunge
through jostling traffic and resonant subways it is of
interest to note that the first thing she did on reaching her
room was to sit right down in her Larkspur-Blue coat and hat
and investigate the word "leisure" in her English Dictionary.
Out of all the various definitions given, "vacancy of mind"
seemed to suit her fancy best. "In the vacancy of my mind is
it that I have promised for this writing?" she questioned.
"Of a very good wellness then! <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>When else should my mind or my
heart be more vacated than now?" </p>

<p>True to this impulse she sat down that very evening to tell
Mrs. Tome Gallien just exactly what she thought of her. On
some very pale, pale yellow note paper, with the blue ink
which she adored, and in the spirited handwriting so
characteristic of her nationality, the very page was a blonde
flare of personality. </p>

<p>MRS. TOME GALLIEN, </p>

<p>DEAREST MADAM (she wrote): </p>

<p>How do you do's. And I know all! Do not do it, I say. Do not
do it. They do not like it and if you so persist in thus
teasing of them you will most certainly defeat the one object
which I am of an inclination to suspect that you have tucked
away in one side of the mind. Is it not so? </p>

<p>You are of course very clever and of much wealthiness and
some pain. And, it is of course very diverting and most droll
lying thus to plan how one may yet motivate the destinies, is
it, that you say? </p>

<p>And it is doubtless as you well think&mdash;the little widow lady
has mourned too long, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>is too delicate of the indoors, and
moons too much over the singing-voice. And this Young Doctor
in his own turn he also is a mistake, so sarcasms, so severe,
and hates all womans and all pianos both, except for minutes.
And you have thought that if thus across the little pain in
the lady's bone these two could be brought to scold about the
pianos and the blind ducks much good might yet come and of a
most loving adjustingment? </p>

<p>But no, Madam it is a great mistake! These people are not at
all as bright as you think. And also in their hearts is there
none of that most happy greed which makes all comical things
as they come one joke! No! It is only that they see in your
gifts one great make-them-mad which if you persist in so
doing with other comics will make them cold with hate and
humiliation for each other. And when you tag the poor little
lady as an Adventure you have yet outraged complete the
chivalries of the Young Doctor so that he cannot even see in
his sense that even so little a widow may yet be a very great
Adventure. </p>

<p>Do not do it, I say! Do not do it! It is <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>cruel. And there is
no law but your own honor that can stop it. </p>

<p>If the malice is so formed that you cannot stop it but must
persist in this most foolish custom of giving people the
things what they do not want I would respectfully suggest
that you send them to me. </p>

<p>I am young. I am strong. And very laughing. If you can find
anything in the world at just this time that I do not want <i>I
dare you to send it to me!</i> </p>

<p>Yours very truly, </p>

<p class="right">SOLVEI KJELLAND. </p>

<p>Being satiate then with justice and the English language
Solvei reverted once more to the pursuit of juvenile
pedagogics and the general discussion of human events with
her own aunt and in her own tongue. </p>

<p>Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, nothing except pedagogics
and the aunt even remotely threatened her horizon. And by
Thursday every gesture of her fine young body, every changing
expression of her fine young face, seemed frankly indicative
of some seething inner triumph that as yet remained <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>unspoken.
By Friday night, however, even this self-control slipped its
leash, and she closed her eyes for sleep with a very distinct
and definite expression of emotion. "Ah!" she laughed, "that
Gallien lady down yonder is good and fixed! Yes!" </p>

<p>It was not until Saturday night, late, by special delivery,
that Mrs. Tome Gallien's answer came. </p>

<p>Stumbling sleepily down the stairs just be fore midnight to
answer the doorbell that no one else seemed awake to answer,
Solvei Kjelland received the insignificant looking envelope
into her own hands. Small as it was, heavily overshadowed by
special delivery postage, and almost quaveringly directed in
a pale, fine writing it might well have suggested to anybody
a suppliant for mercy, or at least for pity. </p>

<p>With a first faint twinge of remorse Solvei tore it open to
discover no contents whatever&mdash;except a railroad ticket to
the little mainland town in South Carolina where Mrs. Tome
Gallien had established her official address. </p>

<p>Scowlingly for a moment and in dumb perplexity the girl stood
shifting from one slippered <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>foot to another in a really
desperate effort to decipher each word, phrase, comma,
asterisk, in the momentous little document be fore her. Then
quite suddenly a smile that was by no means mirthful flashed
brilliantly across her blue eyes and her gleaming teeth. </p>

<p>"<i>Stinged!</i>" said Solvei Kjelland, and gathering her big gray
blanket wrapper a little bit closer around her fled back
precipitously to her bed. </p>

<p>With the first faint ray of morning light perhaps she might
have waked to an instant's reassuring conviction that the
whole ticket episode was a dream if only her subconscious
deductions from that episode had not waked first on her lips
like a wry taste. "The one things in the world that I did not
want&mdash;at just this time? That lady is a witchess!" was the
phrase that waked on her lips. </p>

<p>It was not until early the following week, however, that she
called up the Young Doctor to tell him the news. </p>

<p>"How do you do?" she telephoned. "This is Solvei Kjelland.
And I am to say good-by." </p>

<p>"Good-by? Why, what do you mean?" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>questioned the Young
Doctor's frankly surprised voice. </p>

<p>"It is that I am going away," said Solvei, "on a little&mdash;what
it is you would call a trip." </p>

<p>"Oh," said the Young Doctor. "Where?" </p>

<p>If the statement could ever be made that a Person "shrugged"
his voice Solvei certainly "shrugged" hers. </p>

<p>"Oh, through the tunnel!" she said. "And then off!" </p>

<p>"Yes, but where?" persisted the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Oh, to the Southern Carolines to visit this Mrs. Tome
Gallien," sing-songed the girl as one who had rehearsed the
line even to the point of monotony. </p>

<p>"What?" cried the Young Doctor. "Why&mdash;why, what do you mean?" </p>

<p>"Mean?" bridled Solvei instantly. "For why should it be a
meanness? Is not this Mrs. Tome Gallien as fine a lady as I?
Am I not as fine a lady as Mrs. Tome Gallien? For why if two
ladies like to visit it should not be so? Have I not explain
it all to the sick aunt?" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span> </p>

<p>"Yes, but do you really mean that you wrote to Mrs. Tome
Gallien?" stammered the Young Doctor. "What did you say? For
Heaven's sake what did you say?" </p>

<p>"What I did say should be sealed in my own heart," affirmed
Solvei with some coldness. </p>

<p>"Yes, but my dear child!" protested the Young Doctor. "You
don't seem to have any idea of just what you're  going to!
It's not at all a cheerful sort of place you understand. Why
even its name you know is 'Gloom of the Sea.'" </p>

<p>"Even so," said Solvei, "there is no special pain in that. In
my time have I not already seen several Glooms of the Land?
Why then should I not, for sheer geography, start out to
investigate a 'Gloom of the Sea'?" </p>

<p>"Yes, but it's a&mdash;it's a Desert Island, you know!" persisted
the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"So-o?" brightened Solvei. "And will there then be camels?
N-o?" With a soft sigh of regret her whole personality seemed
to fade for a moment into the indeterminate blur and buzz of
crossed telephone wires. Then clear as a bell her voice rang
out again. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>"And have you seen the little sad lady once more?"
she asked. </p>

<p>"Why she's here in my office now," said the Young Doctor.
"She has to come almost every day." </p>

<p>"So?" mused the Norse girl. "And will it take the long time
perhaps to mend the little pain in the bone?" </p>

<p>"I certainly hope so!" laughed the Young Doctor. And for the
first time since she had heard it there was no irony in the
laugh but sheer boyish happiness. </p>

<p>"You do not seem quite to get the ideas of this little trip
that I should make," she reproached him briskly. "It is not
just that I go! But that I stay! It is not just for the once
it would seem but for the all time that this lady so desires
me! The ticket that she so kindly sends is but one-sided. It
does not return." </p>

<p>"Ticket?" exclaimed the Young Doctor. "Why, this is
preposterous! You don't really mean it, surely? There's
nothing that can make you go, you know!" </p>

<p>"So?" said Solvei. "Did I not make the dare to her? Should I
not pay? Is it not <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>then as you say? I have drawn the fire!"
Across the astonishing gravity of her tone a most joyous
laugh broke suddenly. "Your words are of such a mixedness,"
she laughed. "Drawn? Drawn? Is it not rather as the strong
banks would say, Miss Solvei Kjelland by one lady from the
South has been withdrawn from the circulations? But I adore
this America!" she confided blithely. "Always around every
corner there is something that you did not first expect when
you curled that corner." </p>

<p>"Yes, I know," admitted the Young Doctor. "But what about all
this Montessori study and everything? Are you going to chuck
it? And the little brother? The little lad who isn't?" he
asked with real regret. </p>

<p>"It will all keep," said Solvei. "It is only what is, it
would seem, that should pass." </p>

<p>"Oh, but Miss Kjelland," insisted the Young Doctor, "this
whole thing is absurd! I&mdash;I believe you're  making it all up,
just for a joke! If you're  going to be home next Sunday
afternoon couldn't I come around and&mdash;and laugh the thing out
with you?" </p>

<p>"Next Sunday afternoon?" mused Solvei, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>with the manner of one
who pauses for an instant to count the days on the fingers.
"And this now, this minute, is a Tuesday?" she questioned,
still speculatively. </p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"No! It will not be possible!" said Solvei. "I leave!" </p>

<p>"Yes, but when?" asked the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Now," said Solvei. "Already it is that I can hear the
taxicab adding at the door." </p>

<p>"What?" cried the Young Doctor. </p>

<p>"Under the river!" waved Solvei's clear young voice. "Under
the river, Dr. Sam Kendrue!" </p>

<p>Like a gigantic gray-brown wonder bulb the northern winter is
dumped down thus at will into the sunny, plushy forcing frame
of a New York Pullman to bloom in perfect scent and glory
only one day, two days, three days later in some welcoming
Southland. </p>

<p>If Solvei Kjelland was astonished, however, at the first
bland sights that met her blizzard-habituated eyes it is only
fair to say that Mrs. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>Tome Gallien in all her years of
experience in every kind of a Southland had never seen any
thing that astonished her as much as the sight of Solvei
Kjelland. </p>

<p>Fuming helplessly in her great mahogany bed with its weird-
carven bed-posts of pirate and sailor and siren, the sick
woman lay staring blankly from the ceiling to the piazza
railing and from the piazza railing to the dull gray sea when
the vision first burst upon her. </p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;Martha!" she screamed to her deaf woman. "There is
a bright blue girl in the wrangle boat! And nobody is
wrangling! They are coming right along, I mean! Scudding! And
the girl is running the engine!" </p>

<p>From her own quick glance at the scene the deaf woman's
answering voice came back as calm, as remote, as de-
magnetized as the voice of an old letter. </p>

<p>"You sent for a girl to come, I believe," said the deaf
woman. </p>

<p>"Yes, I know," fumed Mrs. Tome Gallien. "But I hardly dreamed
for a moment that she really would!" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>

<p>"What?" said the deaf woman. </p>

<p>"Never&mdash;dreamed&mdash;that&mdash;she&mdash;would!" repeated Mrs. Tome Gallien
as economically as she could. </p>

<p>"Most things that you send for&mdash;seem to come," monotoned the
deaf woman by no means unamiably. "There's no room left in
the storeroom now for the last box of Japanese bric-a-brac,
or the French wedding gown or the new-fangled fireless
cooker. Where shall we put the girl?" </p>

<p>"In the fireless cooker!" snapped Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>From the vague acquiescent smile on Martha's face it was
evident that she sensed the spirit if not the words of the
suggestion. </p>

<p>The next direction however was startlingly clear. With a
quite unmistakable gesture Mrs. Tome Gallien pointed toward
the stairs. </p>

<p>"Martha! Go to it!" she screamed. </p>

<p>To a person lying in bed voices travel so much quicker than
do the owners of the voices. Through what seemed an eternity
then of time and noise, boat-keels grounding, men grumbling,
boys shouting, women chattering, the sick woman waited in the
lonely hush of her immediate surroundings with a very
perceptible shiver of nervousness flashing from moment to
moment across her spine. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<div class="center"><img src="images/5_as_coolly_as_if.jpg" alt="As coolly as if"/>
<div class="caption">As coolly as if she had been appraising a new dog or pussy,
Mrs. Tome Gallien narrowed her eyes to both the vision and the announcement </div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>

<p>Then all a-glow and a-blow and theatrically incongruous like
some splendid young Viking of Old rigged out in a girl's blue
and ultramodern rain-coat, the stranger loomed up suddenly at
the foot of the bed with Martha's portly white figure
backgrounding every radiant flutter and line of the blue and
gold silhouette. </p>

<p>"I am come!" said Solvei Kjelland. </p>

<p>As coolly as if she had been appraising a new dog or pussy
Mrs. Tome Gallien narrowed her eyes to both the vision and
the announcement. </p>

<p>"Certainly you are a very good-looking young person!" she
conceded at last. "But of such an ungodly name! Is there no
way to overcome it?" </p>

<p>"Over&mdash;come it?" puzzled Solvei for a single shadowed
instant. "Oh, that is most easy," she brightened, almost at
once. "Solway it is as though it was. And Ch-Chelland." </p>

<p>"You may call me 'Elizabeth,'" said Mrs. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>Tome Gallien without
the flicker of an eyelash. </p>

<p>"E-lee-sa-buth?" repeated the girl painstakingly. </p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose that will do," sighed Mrs. Tome Gallien,
struggling up a little bit higher on her pillows. "But
whatever in the world made you come?" she demanded tartly. </p>

<p>But if the question was like a dash of cold water, Solvei's
reaction to it was at least the reaction of a duck's back. </p>

<p>"You mean you did not really want me?" she preened and
fluttered. Her voice was ecstasy, her eyes like stars. </p>

<p>"I certainly did not," sliced Mrs. Tome Gallien's clear
incisive voice. </p>

<p>"Oh, of what a joyousness and retribution!" beamed Solvei.
"Of what a gloriosity! As the shooting camping is to the sad
little lady, and the piano to the Young Doctor,&mdash;so thus am I
to you! What then shall happen to everyone of us is yet on
the lap of the gods! Let us kiss!" she suggested as one prize
fighter might proffer his hand to another. </p>

<p>"I am not a kisser, thank you," said Mrs. Tome Gallien with
some coldness. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>

<p>"So-o?" acquiesced the girl softly. If her spirit faltered
for an instant, her blue eyes fortunately faltered no lower
than the great clutter of boxes that flanked Mrs. Gallien's
bed in every direction. "For why are there so many boxes?"
she looked up suddenly to ask with a smile that would have
disarmed a Tartar. </p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why those are just some things I've been buying
lately," relaxed Mrs. Tome Gallien ever so slightly. "There
isn't so very much to do here, some days, except just to read
the advertisements in the back of the magazines&mdash;and send for
things. Martha hates it!" she added with a sudden wry glance
at Martha's impassive face. </p>

<p>"O-h!" said Solvei. And the word was divided absolutely
evenly between praise of the boxes and disparagement of
Martha. </p>

<p>The boxes seemed to have heard their part of it anyway. The
string on a huge brown paper package burst suddenly as though
for sheer excitement. </p>

<p>"Martha will show you to your room," said Mrs. Tome Gallien
quite imperviously. "And whatever else you try to jar, pray
don't waste <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span> your energies trying to jar Martha. By a most
merciful dispensation of Providence her sensibilities have
been wrapped in a cotton batting silence for the past twenty
years. You may in time learn to understand me," she smiled
faintly with her first kindness. "But you will never
understand Martha. Come back to me after supper, if you wish.
And wear something blue if you have it. I like you in blue." </p>

<p>It was long after supper when Solvei returned. But at least
she was in blue, and a very neat and trim blue it was and
essentially boyish with its soft collar rolling back sailor-
wise from her slender throat. Like one fairly consumed with
the winter novelty of boats and beaches, too full of a
hundred new excitements to speak, she dropped down on the low
footstool by Mrs. Tome Gallien's pungent, smoky, lightwood
fire, and with her blue elbows on her blue knees and her
white chin cupped in her white hands, sat staring wide-eyed
at her hostess. The whole breathless significance of youth
was in her face. Youth struggled eternally for its own best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>self-expression. But when she spoke, a single sentence only
burst from her lips. </p>

<p>"What was in that big brown bundle-box that should burst so?"
she asked with a sudden elfish impudence. </p>

<p>But instead of being annoyed by the question, Mrs. Tome
Gallien seemed on the contrary to be rather amused with it. </p>

<p>"You like boxes?" she asked with a faintly quizzical lift of
her eyebrows. </p>

<p>"Boxes?" flamed Solvei. "It is like the new day! When the
string breaks&mdash;it is the dawn! 'What should there then be in
it?' jumps the heart. What is there yet that will come?" </p>

<p>"Oh, dear me," smiled Mrs. Tome Gallien. "If you feel like
that about it by all means come and open it. I forget myself
what is in it, there are so many. Nuts maybe," she laughed,
"or a new carpet sweeper. Or a sable muff even!" </p>

<p>With all the frank eagerness of a child Solvei Kjelland
jumped up to investigate the mystery, and like a kitten
snarling itself into worsteds disappeared for the moment <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>into
interminable pale-colored tissue papers, only to emerge at
last brandishing on high the plumpest, gaudiest, altogether
most hideous hand-embroidered sofa pillow that human eyes
were ever forced to contemplate. </p>

<p>"It is not nuts," said Solvei Kjelland. In another moment she
had clasped the pillow to her breast. "Oh, of what a horror!"
she laughed. "And how beloved! Is it the work then," she
demanded, "of a blind one? Or of one crazy? Or of one both
blind and crazy?" Back of the laughter and the question was a
sincere and unmistakable concern. </p>

<p>"A clergyman's widow makes them," confided Mrs. Tome Gallien.
"Somebody over in Alabama,&mdash;I saw the advertisement in a
country newspaper. I take a whole lot of country newspapers
for just that sort of amusement," she added a bit drily.
"There seems to be such an everlasting number of bunglers in
the world who are trying so desperately hard to make a little
money. This woman I believe is trying to send her boy to
college." </p>

<p>With the pillow extended precipitously to full arm's length
Solvei sat for a moment <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>staring from the chaotic embroidery
to Mrs. Tome Gallien's perfectly composed face. </p>

<p>"Could a boy come to any of the good that should go to
college on a pillow like that?" she demanded uproariously,
while all the laughing curves of her mouth seemed reaching
suddenly up to fend off the threat of tears in her eyes. Once
again she clasped the pillow to her breast. "Oh, the bridge
that it does make into the other's life!" she cried. "Can you
not see all at once, the house, the desolation, the no store
anywhere with fine goods to compare with! The boy so thin, so
white, so eager perhaps, so watching of every stitch! That
most dreadful magenta? Will there be by the grace of the good
God a chance perhaps for the Latin? That screaming oranges?
Should it be humanly possible that so much joys as histories
and boots might yet be in the same world with the Latin. And
the mother? So pricked with needles? So consumed with
hopings&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"You&mdash;you see it, do you?" drawled Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>"See it?" flamed Solvei. "I <i>am</i> it!" With the gesture of one
who sought suddenly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>to hide her emotion she swung around
abruptly toward the other side of the room. "What else is
there then?" she asked, all laughter and mischief again.
"That box so wooden, so busted at the top? Is that also a
bridge to some other livings?" </p>

<p>"If you choose to call it so," nodded Mrs. Tome Gallien. A
frankly quizzical invitation to explore was in the nod. </p>

<p>Solvei certainly needed no urging. In another instant down on
her knees before the great wooden box, she was slowly
extracting from wads of excelsior, piece after piece of the
most exquisitely delicate and transparent turquoise blue
china beaded in gold and airily overwrought with soaring sea
gulls. There was a big breakfast cup, and a middle-sized
breakfast cup, and a big plate, and a middle-sized plate, and
a cereal saucer and another cereal saucer, and a most stately
little coffee pot and all the other attendants and attendants
to attendants which Fashion assigns to just that sort of a
service. </p>

<p>"Oh, it is for the fairies then?" gasped Solvei. "Or a
Princess?" Deftly as she spoke she pulled a great white sheet
of paper <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span> to her and spread it on the floor as a cloth. "No!"
she quickened. "It is for lovers! See? The first breakfast of
the new home?" As cautiously as though she had been handling
butterfly wings she began to dramatize the scene, the big
plate there, the middle-sized plate here, a man's elbow-room,
thus, a woman's daintiness, so! In the ingenuousness of her
own visualization she lifted the bride's cup to her lips and
sipped an ecstatic draught from it. </p>

<p>"Mocha or Java?" mocked Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>"Joy!" said Solvei Kjelland. </p>

<p>In a sudden fit of abstraction then the girl struggled slowly
to her knees and knelt thus staring very thoughtfully all
around her. </p>

<p>"So is it then with all these boxes?" she asked. "That from
this desert island lying so you would make constantly such
little bridges across to other people's livings? In time, it
is, I mean, as soon as you should bear to part with them you
would build even these most Heavenish dishes across to some
young happiness? But will such a young happiness ever take
the troubles to cross back to you?" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>she demanded with sudden
fierceness. "That is it, I say! That is it! A prattling note
perhaps? A praise-you for being so rich? But do they ever yet
write more late to tell that the gift is still well, that it
has made new joy that very morning perhaps, that even yet
after one month, six months, twenty, it is still so dear?" </p>

<p>"They never have," admitted Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>In utter irrelevance the girl sank back on her heels and
crossing her arms on her breast began to rock herself
joyously to and fro. </p>

<p>"Oh, I do love this place so!" she confided. "I do love it
so! And if you should then keep me," she beamed. "And I
should be quite pleasant,&mdash;there is a lawn mower I read in
yesterday's paper! Most wonderful it is, and runs by the
gasolene, so that all one needs to do is to follow singing
gaily. Could you send for such?" </p>

<p>"A lawn mower?" sniffed Mrs. Tome Gallien. "You noticed, I
trust, that there was no nice grass whatsoever on this
island?" </p>

<p>"Yes, that is most so," admitted Solvei. "Neither equally is
there any young <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>happinesses or bare-toed boys making for
Latin. But if we were possessed of such a lawn mower and its
wonderfulness we could at least make the fine green lawns in
the mind." </p>

<p>"Solvei!" snapped Mrs. Tome Gallien, "I am dreadfully afraid
that I am going to like you! But before I actually commit
myself," she frowned, "I want to ask you one question. Are
you in the habit of letting strange young men kiss you?" </p>

<p>"What?" jumped Solvei. </p>

<p>Very significantly Mrs. Tome Gallien repeated the question.
"Strange young men?" she revised it. "Are you in the habit of
letting strange young men kiss you?" </p>

<p>"Oh!" flushed Solvei. "It is then the Young Doctor that you
mean? Was it so that he thus confessed it to you?" she
questioned a bit bewilderedly. "So shamed he was, so worried,
I had not just thought that he should tell. Yes, it is as you
say he is one most strange young man." </p>

<p>"Yes, but you?" persisted Mrs. Tome Gallien. "How did you
feel about it? That's what I want to know!" </p>

<p>"How should I feel?" laughed Solvei. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>"Why it was so mad I
was, so strong, I could have crushed him on the steps! And
then suddenly I see his face! Bah!" shrugged Solvei. "I have
one father and nine brothers and all the world is most full
of men! It is not from such a face as the Young Doctor's that
any evil should come. It is just as I have said, one very sad
accident!" </p>

<p>"It does not seem to be just the sadness of the accident that
lingers longest in your mind," drawled Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>With her chin tip-tilted and her eyes like stars the girl met
the sarcasm without a flicker of resentment. </p>

<p>"No!" she laughed. "It is not the sadness of the accident
that remains longest in the mind!" </p>

<p>"U-m-mmmm," mused Mrs. Tome Gallien. "All the same," she
resumed with sharpness, "I certainly think it was most cruel,
most brutal of him, not to make the trip down here with me!
It would have done him good," she insisted. "Just the mere
balmy change of it! He is so grim!" </p>

<p>"Oh, but he cannot help the being grim," flared Solvei. "He
is so poor and so wanting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>things! How should he yet achieve
them except by sticking close to that most saddest of all
truths that the only ways to get ahead is to stay behind and
attend to one's business?" </p>

<p>"Solvei!" asked Mrs. Tome Gallien quite abruptly. "Have you
gotten the impression in any way that the Young Doctor was&mdash;
was attracted at all to my little widow friend?" </p>

<p>"Oh, of a surety!" attested Solvei. "He is I think what one
would say 'crazy' of her." </p>

<p>"Oh, I hardly dare to hope that," mused Mrs. Tome Gallien.
"But of course&mdash;" In some far-away speculation the sentence
faded suddenly off into silence. "She will of course be very
rich some day, I suppose," she resumed a bit haughtily. "I
shall, I suppose, make her my heir." </p>

<p>"S-o?" said Solvei Kjelland. </p>

<p>"Solvei!" snapped Mrs. Tome Gallien with another spurt of
abruptness. "Speaking of 'attending to one's business,' if
<i>you</i> should decide to stay here and make <i>me</i> your business,
what do you think you could do for me?" </p>

<p>"Oh, I could do the reading aloud," brightened Solvei
instantly. "And I could thus open the boxes! And I could run
the wrangle <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>boat!" she quickened and glowed. "And also if it
should so seem best I could scrub the blue flannel crockings
from the Wrangle Boy's neck!" </p>

<p>"On the whole&mdash;as a really steady employment," conceded Mrs.
Tome Gallien, "suppose we begin on the reading aloud. I adore
being read to." </p>

<p>"Oh, I am very fine on this reading aloud!" preened Solvei.
"So dramatic is it that you say? So intensed?" With absolute
self-assurance she picked up the only book in reach, it
happened to be the "Golden Treasury," and just out of sheer
temperamental eagerness selected the biggest-looking poem she
could find. "It should be an 'Ode,' is it that you call it?"
she confided. "And it is about&mdash;about&mdash;? I do not know such
words," she faltered for a single second only and passed the
page to Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Tome Gallien, "Wordsworth, you mean. 'Ode on
Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early
Childhood.'" </p>

<p>"S-o?" conceded Solvei. "All that? It is not certainly of a
poetry sound but <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>more&mdash;later perhaps it will tell. All the
rest is most easy looking. </p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>"There was&mdash;some time" (she began) "when&mdash;when </p>
<p class='indent4'>meadows, groves, also streams, </p>
<p>"The earth and all things perfectly&mdash;ordinary </p>
<p>"To me did&mdash;did seems </p>
<p>"Ap-pareled&mdash;" I do not know that word and </p>
<p class='indent4'>here is another&mdash;" in ce&mdash;les&mdash;tial lightings, </p>
<p>"The&mdash;&mdash;" </p>
</div></div>


<p>"Yes&mdash;anybody could see at once that you are a remarkable
reader!" slashed Mrs. Tome Gallien's coolest, thinnest voice.
"The picture it suggests of our long spring evenings together
is&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>With a startled glance upward Solvei detected for the first
time the actual glinting mockery in the older woman's eyes.
"What is it?" she stammered. "What?" Still like some one more
bewildered than hurt she struggled to her feet. "Even as from
the first," she questioned, "is it that you are making the
sport of me when I wish so hard to do <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>the things that would
please you? Through and through, is your heart then so
cruel?" she demanded, "that it must make mockerings of the
confused and the far-from-homes?" </p>

<p>"Oh, Solvei!" cried the older woman suddenly. "Smile again!
Laugh again! I can't bear it! It's as though the sun had
died! It's as though the moon had gone! If you are angry and
leave me, I shall be left all alone again with just the fog
and the sea! I am a brute, and I know it! But oh, if you will
only just smile again! Even just once, I mean! Oh, my poor
dear little girl," she implored her. "Oh, my poor dear touchy
little blonde girl!" </p>

<p>"I am not a 'poor&mdash;poor little blonde girl,'" asserted Solvei
with some spirit. "I am indeed as I said, very young, very
strong. And very laughing," she insisted without even the
remotest flicker of a smile. </p>

<p>"Are you young enough and strong enough and laughing enough
to come over here and sit on my bed?" rallied Mrs. Tome
Gallien. </p>

<p>"I am young enough and strong enough <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>and laughing enough to
do anything!" said Solvei Kjelland. </p>

<p>Stiff and stern as a ramrod she went over and sat on the side
of the Sick Woman's bed. </p>

<p>Without an atom of self-consciousness or embarrassment both
women began all over again to study each other's faces. </p>

<p>"Could I put my hand on your yellow hair?" asked Mrs. Gallien
at last quite surprisingly. </p>

<p>"You could put your hand on my yellow hair," said Solvei. </p>

<p>"If I should apologize fairly decently for existing at all,"
experimented Mrs. Tome Gallien a little further, "would you
be willing to kiss now? </p>

<p>"I should never be willing," sighed Solvei, "to kiss any lips
that tasted of mockerings." </p>

<p>"What would you be willing to do?" ventured Mrs. Tome
Gallien. </p>

<p>"What would you want me to do?" relaxed Solvei ever so
slightly. </p>

<p>Through Mrs. Tome Gallien's busy brain a dozen possible
answers tested themselves one against the other. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>

<p>"Well, would you be willing to&mdash;to tell me a little story?"
she chose as the most promising one. </p>

<p>"Tell you a little story?" queried Solvei. Once again her
whole face darkened with suspicion. </p>

<p>"Yes, about my little island," hurried Mrs. Tome Gallien. "It
was dark when I came and they put me right into this bed. I
do not leave my bed, you know." </p>

<p>"What?" quivered Solvei. "This most beautiful little island,
you have not seen it&mdash;since you came?" In the very tensity of
the question all the blue seemed to surge back suddenly to
her eyes, all the pink to her cheeks. "Why of a sureness,"
she cried, "will I tell you about this little island!" Softly
then for a moment she patted her skirts and recrossed her
slippered feet and fumbled with the big silk tie that closed
her collar. Then quite geographically she began her
narrative. "First of all," she explained, "it is a round
little island." </p>

<p>"Really, you surprise me," said Mrs. Tome Gallien purely
automatically. "So many islands are square." <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>

<p>"And there are fish upon it!" glowed the narrator. </p>

<p>"Oh, surely not upon it?" shivered Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>"And there are seven monstrous what you call 'live-oak' trees
dripping with gray beards,&mdash;it is most terrible," gloated the
narrator. "And in one tree alone have I seen with my own eyes
seven most scarlet birds and two blue birds. And in yet
another tree there is a fine snake.&mdash;And all along by what
you should call the edge of the porch blue violets are
coming. And on the roof where the wrangle boat sleeps there
is an green vine that shall yet be yellow and sweet, Martha
tells. And&mdash;and&mdash;" Around the corners of the girl's red lips
a faint little smile showed suddenly. "And there is one
little black pig, so grunting!" she announced with rapture.
"And&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>So the sweet, eager, revitalizing young voice ran on till
Martha herself appeared to announce Sleeping Time, and Mrs.
Tome Gallien whose "sleeping time" for years had been a farce
of ghost and specter dozed off before she was even half
undressed to dream like a child <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>of budding violets and
flitting birds and a glow that should be of jessamine instead
of gold. </p>

<p>Hours fall so easily out of a day, days out of a week, weeks
out of a month! </p>

<p>The jessamine glow did come in its own good time as did also
various other things which Nature had ordained, March winds,
March rains, March tides, March sunshine. </p>

<p>Other wonders came too that were of course Mrs. Tome
Gallien's ordaining rather than Nature's fabulous shoppings
from all the big marts of the world, and little pitiful, home
made products from backwoods settlement or lonely prairie. </p>

<p>Once and for all time relieved of the hazardous task of
reading aloud to a capricious invalid, Solvei came and went
like a young Sea Breeze, whistling through the halls, singing
through the rooms, sweeping across the island, frolicking on
the water. If it was fair to rate her as a rather
exceptionally clever and daring young navigator on the sea of
fact it was only fair to acknowledge her equally clever,
equally daring in the realms of fancy. Smiling knowingly into
Martha's silences, laughing at the wrangle boat man or boy,
waving a slim hand <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span> in and out of Mrs. Tome Gallien's narrow
sea-blue vista, scudding to and from the mainland on
interminable errands, or curled up for long cozy evenings on
the foot of Mrs. Tome Gallien's bed to visualize their mutual
magic path across one new box or another into "other people's
livings," Solvei Kjelland as a companion was frankly a
success. </p>

<p>Then one day very late in March, or even the first of April,
something came which was partly of Nature's ordaining and
partly of Mrs. Tome Gallien's, though most thoroughly a
surprise to the latter one concerned. </p>

<p>It was a letter from Dr. Sam Kendrue. And very Northern.
Whatever the New York winter had been it was plainly evident
that the New York spring was still exceedingly cold. </p>

<p>MRS. TOME GALLIEN, </p>

<p>DEAR MADAM (said the letter): </p>

<p>As it seems best to me at just this time that Mrs. Kendrue
should supplement her treatment with a trip South, it is my
intention to accompany her. In view of this fact I will take
the liberty of calling upon you on Tuesday <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>next. Trusting
that your island experience has proved beneficial to your
health, </p>

<p>I am, Yours truly, etc., etc. </p>

<p>"U-m-mmmm," smiled Mrs. Tome Gallien. But before the dull,
fretted bewilderment in Solvei Kjelland's face, her smile
sharpened suddenly into impatience. "Why surely, Solvei," she
scolded. "With all your English you might at least understand
that." </p>

<p>"N-o," shifted Solvei from one slim ankle to the other. "It
does not seem to me of any understanding whatever&mdash;whether it
should be Dr. Sam Kendrue's Mrs. Kendrue who comes or just
Mrs. Kendrue's Mrs. Kendrue?" </p>

<p>"O-h, of course," rallied Mrs. Tome Gallien's good nature.
"One could hardly expect them to be married by now, or even
engaged perhaps. But at least they must be awfully
interested! How about your poor hardworking young doctor
<i>now?</i>" she gloated; "couldn't take the tiniest holiday for a
poor old gray-haired, crippled creature like me! But has got
time to burn when it comes to some little soft dark-eyed
thing with a creak in her singing-voice!" <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>

<p>"Love is sure some pranks," admitted Solvei. </p>

<p>"<i>A</i> prank," corrected Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>"A prank," repeated Solvei with perfect docility. </p>

<p>From the increasing sweetness of her day dreams Mrs. Tome
Gallien turned idly to the calendar on the table by her
bedside. The week's page had not been torn off, nor the week
before that, if the whole truth must be known. </p>

<p>"Why, Good Lack!" she jerked suddenly. "To-day is Tuesday!" </p>

<p>"So?" jumped Solvei. </p>

<p>Both women turned simultaneously toward the clock. </p>

<p>"It will take you half an hour to make the mainland and that
train!" cried Mrs. Tome Gallien. "And for goodness sake,
brush your hair! And change those old sea-faring clothes." </p>

<p>"I will not brush the hair," tossed Solvei's bright wind-
blown head. "Always it is my preference to wear it thus
hither-and-hang! Nor will I part ever from my friend this old
blue jersey! And even so&mdash;if the sun does <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>not fade between
the here and the mainland I may yet achieve three new
freckles on my nose!" </p>

<p>"Don't argue!" fumed Mrs. Tome Gallien. "Just hurry!" </p>

<p>"It is only when one hurries that one has time to argue,"
persisted the girl. </p>

<p>"Oh, stop your nonsense!" ordered Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>"Whose nonsense will then be left to us?" flared Solvei. "But
do not thus make all this extra worrisome," she admonished
with sudden gentleness. "Time is always more fat than you
think! But for two such fancy fine packages as I go now to
fetch," she flared again ever so slightly, "there will not be
room also in the boat for the face of the wrangle boat man
nor yet for the legs of the boy. It is alone I insist that I
should go!" </p>

<p>"For mercy's sake!" fretted Mrs. Tome Gallien. "I don't care
how you go, if you'll only go!" </p>

<p>Without further parleying, Solvei started for the stairs. In
another minute with a few jumps and slides she had reached
the front door. Once outside, it took but a fraction <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>more of
time to settle the wrangle boat man and boy. </p>

<p>"Sitting here in perfect peace on the shore," she admonished
them, "watch thus how one isolated person with no words but
oil can make a boat prance on the waves! All aboard!" she
called back exultantly to them. </p>

<p>With a chug like a great, pounding heartthrob the wrangle
boat sprang for the sea. Just for a moment then at the last
signaling point Solvei lifted her hand in unfailing
cheeriness to the sick woman and the deaf woman left behind,
and turned her own inordinately sharpened young senses toward
the mainland. </p>

<p>But when the ructious little wrangle boat drew up a half hour
later alongside the dilapidated mainland wharf before an
admiring audience of jet black pickaninnies and mangy hounds
there was only one passenger waiting impatiently there, and
that passenger was Dr. Sam Kendrue. </p>

<p>"How do you do, Dr. Sam Kendrue?" said Solvei. </p>

<p>"How do <i>you</i> do, Miss Solvei Kjelland?" grinned Doctor
Kendrue. </p>

<p>With more agility than one might have <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>dared to hope for from
one who boasted so much winter in his blood, the Young Doctor
snatched up his valise, jumped down into the wrangle boat and
pushed off. </p>

<p>To avoid running into a sunken rowboat and a floating snag,
Solvei was compelled to start her engine, and turn sharply
out to sea. </p>

<p>"Where then is your Mrs. Kendrue?" she called a bit
breathlessly above the lap of wind and water. </p>

<p>"It is my Mrs. Kendrue that I have come to get!" said the
Young Doctor. </p>

<p>With a little oil can poised abruptly in midair, Solvei
opened the same old bewildered blue eyes at him. </p>

<p>"Oh, no," she hastened to disillusion him. "Your Mrs. Kendrue
is not yet on our island." </p>

<p>"No, of course she isn't," laughed the Young Doctor. "And
there's a jolly good reason why, and the reason is&mdash;because
she's right here in the boat!" </p>

<p>"What?" stammered Solvei. With frenzied haste she began very
suddenly to oil everything in reach. "What?" she repeated
vaguely. </p>

<p>"I mean just what I say," said the Young <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>Doctor, and made a
slight move as of one who would cross one cramped knee over
the other. </p>

<p>With all the joy of a foreigner easing his dictional panic
with an idiom, Solvei snatched out at the first phrase she
could think of that had a familiar word in it. </p>

<p>"Sit down! You're rocking the boat!" she screamed. </p>

<p>"Silly!" said the Young Doctor. "I was once in a boat
before!" Quite wretchedly he began then and there to try and
recover his old manner, the irony, the mocking. "Really, Miss
Kjelland," he ducked as a great cloud of spray went by him.
"Really Miss Kjelland, you're awfully rough with boats! Oh,
but Solvei," he broke through again in spite of himself. "You
understand what I'm trying to say, now don't you?" </p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Solvei Kjelland with her great blue eyes
staring straight ahead through the veil of her windblown hair
at some far focal point just over the wrangle boat's prancing
bow. </p>

<p>Once again a great cloud of spray missed the Young Doctor by
the width only of his dodge. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>

<p>"And how is it then about Mrs. Kendrue's Mrs. Kendrue?" asked
Solvei quite suddenly out of the gusty sky. </p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Young Doctor with the most surprising revival
of cheerfulness. "Why&mdash;why she's gone on down to investigate
her new duck blind with the rest of her party. There's a
tenor, it seems, who is rather,&mdash;well, contenting. You could
hardly use any other word with her, she's so awfully
inexpressive. Anyway it's a diverting friendship for her,
though whether the tenor can hit a high duck as niftily as he
can hit a high note, remains of course to be seen." </p>

<p>"S-o?" said Solvei with indifferent interest. "And is the
piano well?" </p>

<p>"Oh, fairly well," conceded the Young Doctor. "But if ever I
saw a piano that needed a mother's care! I had to board it
out, you know?" </p>

<p>"S-o?" crooned Solvei's sweet low voice. </p>

<p>It was astonishing though how soon the sea calmed down after
that. At least there was no more spray. </p>

<p>Skirting round at last along the sunny sheltered side of the
little island instead of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>splashing boldly up to the regular
landing as was her usual custom, it seemed indeed as though
Solvei was suddenly trying to feed out serenity to the man
before her. The floating gray moss of the live-oak trees was
certainly serene, the twitter of birds, the soft, warm drone
of insect. Without an interrupting word she drove the boat's
nose into a roughly improvised harbor of floating logs and a
raft, jumped out upon the raft and beckoned the Young Doctor
to follow her. </p>

<p>But at the first soft-padded thud of his foot on the turf it
was the Young Doctor himself who broke the vocal silence. </p>

<p>"Oh, but Solvei!" he protested. "You've got to know that you
are the only Mrs. Kendrue that I want!" </p>

<p>"S-o?" queried Solvei, glancing back with a vaguely skeptical
smile across her blue jersey shoulder. </p>

<p>"Oh, of course," admitted the Young Doc tor, "just right away
at the very first I didn't know it perhaps. You were so&mdash;so,&mdash;
well, so sort of unusual," he flushed, "and so awfully
independent! About the Adventure and the Little Widow and
everything, you <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>made it so perfectly plain you didn't need me
that it wasn't till you'd actually gone that I half woke up
to the fact how much I needed you! Why, Solvei, after you ran
away the city was like a gray fog with no light in it, no
laughter, no anything! The days were a week long, the nights,
a month! Is it any wonder that I should feel as though I'd
loved you for almost ever and ever? Why, if it hadn't been
for my work, and the knowledge that work and work only could
bring me to you&mdash;? Oh, I know it's awfully sudden and
everything!" he persisted desperately. "But why people prate
so everlastingly about 'Love at first sight' and never make
any talk at all about 'Love at first absence'! Solvei you've
simply got to understand!" he cried out. </p>

<p>In her few steps lead of him the girl stopped suddenly and
turned around. </p>

<p>"But of what good is it that I should understand?" she asked
with a little appealing gesture of her hands. "In my far
Norway is it not that I have still the cause of the little
brother? And here?" she puzzled, "How could I yet leave
Elizabeth?" </p>

<p>"Elizabeth?" questioned the Young Doctor. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Tome Gallien," explained the girl. </p>

<p>"Elizabeth?" repeated the Young Doctor with increasing
astonishment. "You mean you are such friends as that?" </p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the girl. "I am such friends as that." </p>

<p>Across the lovely earnestness of her face sun and shadow
flickered intermittently. Softly her blue eyes brooded. Her
bright gold hair was like a flame. In all that sunny, singing
island there was no radiance like her unless perhaps it was
the blue bird who flashed through the gray moss just beyond
her. </p>

<p>"I cannot leave the little brother," she said. "Nor can I
leave the Elizabeth." As though kindled by the spring's own
sweet her whole musing face flamed suddenly with joy. "Nor
yet.&mdash;I am so greedy!" she cried, "<i>nor yet can I leave
you!</i>" </p>

<p>All unbeknown then to Mrs. Tome Gallien or even to Martha,
they crept up the stairs at last to Mrs. Tome Gallien's room,
where with the poor Young Doctor relegated ignominiously
behind her, Solvei chose for her own whimsical purposes to
make her dramatic entrance. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>

<p>"Good afternoon to you, then, Elizabeth!" she hailed casually
to the impatient Sick Woman on the bed. "This of a surety is </p>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>'One time when meadows, groves, also streams, </p>
<p>To me&mdash;did seems </p>
<p>A&mdash;apparelled in celestial lightings!'" </p>
</div></div>


<p>"What?" gasped Mrs. Tome Gallien. "Why, what makes your
cheeks so red?" she demanded suddenly. </p>

<p>"I got kissed again," said Solvei. </p>

<p>"What?" snapped Mrs. Tom Gallien. </p>

<p>"They did not come," said Solvei. "No such Kendrues
combination as you suggested. Nothing came!" said Solvei.
"Except just one big package for me!" </p>

<p>"For you?" frowned Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>"For me!" shrugged Solvei. "And though it should be hard yet
to tell just what livings it shall lead to&mdash;it shall at least
lead to much lovings." </p>

<p>"What?" puzzled Mrs. Tome Gallien. </p>

<p>"This is it!" said Solvei, and dragged the Young Doctor into
the room. </p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" screamed Mrs. Tome Gallien. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>

<p>"It is for <i>me!</i> You understand?" beamed the girl. </p>

<p>In the convulsive laughter that overtook the Young Doctor he
did not at the moment notice Mrs. Tome Gallien's face. </p>

<p>But there was no laughter of any kind in Mrs. Tome Gallien's
face, only shock, and a most furious rage. </p>

<p>"So it is thus you have been deceiving me?" she cried out to
Solvei. "All this time that you knew what my heart was fixed
on, my hopes, my everything! All this time that you have been
here a guest in my house! And quite safe I supposed from any
such&mdash;&mdash;" </p>

<p>"Oh, now really, Mrs. Gallien!" interposed the Young Doctor's
grimmest, sternest voice. </p>

<p>"Oh, of what a nonsense!" laughed Solvei. "There is no blames
anywhere&mdash;unless it should be to this Montessori theory! Out
of the whole wide world is it not that a child must gravitate
to his own wantings? It cannot be chosen for him?" </p>

<p>Then with all the young laughter gone from her face she
reached out her slim brown hand to the Young Doctor's
reassuring clasp and led him to the bed. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>

<p>"Elizabeth," she said. "You are rich and you are sick and you
are sometimes very cross. But you cannot buy the loving! Here
then are two children who would love you all your life long&mdash;
all their lives long. If you thus furiously so refuse the
gift, who then is the stingy receiver?" </p>

<p>"What?" stammered Mrs. Tome Gallien. "What?" Across her
haggard, rage-stricken face a smile of incredulous
enlightenment flickered suddenly. "What?" she surrendered.
"You&mdash;you&mdash;<i>rascals!</i>" And held out her aching arms to them. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
